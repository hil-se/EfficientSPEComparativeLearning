"Media Streamer: remove Viewer space
Since services will no longer be run directly by users, there is no longer a need for the Media Streamer service to produce the contents of the Viewer space. Those generated files are not used as part of the service, they are only provided as examples for how a user might integrate the media streamer service with their own website.  This task is to: - Add a copy of the generated files (updated to be more generic) with some surrounding instructions to the DuraCloud documentation - Update the Media Streamer service to no longer generate these example files",1

"Formatting on ""upload-tool"" space
The display on the Spaces tab causes any space named ""upload-tool"" to be formatted incorrectly. This is because the <div id=""upload-tool""> that is created for the space on the page happens to match up with a css entry for #upload-tool (which is meant for a div in upload-tool.jsp). As it turns out, there are several space names which can cause odd UI behavior for the same reason, such as: ""spaces-list-view-resizer"", ""footer-content"", ""logo-ds"" (which is particularly strange looking), etc. There should be a strategy for making sure that these kinds of name collisions don't happen.  The attached file shows how the display reacts to the ""upload-tool"" space.",1

Currently, when a new space is created, then a call to ask for the manifest is made, the response is a 404. Instead, the response should be a 200 and an empty manifest list should be returned.

To reproduce:  1. Display a space 2. Make the Space Detail pane wider. 3. Note how the line graph labels are skewed. ",1
"Secondary Provider Audit Entry Sequencing
This issue is to resolve the bug occasionally seen in the content manifest when running dup-on-change. Sometimes ingest and delete messaging events lose sequence on the secondary provider.  To create this scenario, an item must already exist in a space, then be deleted and immediately re-ingested. It is not a common production scenario. The attached audit log demonstrates such a case. Note, the actual content in both the primary and secondary stores were actually the same, but the secondary store does not show file-6.txt in its manifest:  space-id        content-id      MD5 manitest        file-0.txt      b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184 manitest        file-10.txt     b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184 manitest        file-1.txt      b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184 manitest        file-2.txt      b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184 manitest        file-3.txt      b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184 manitest        file-4.txt      b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184 manitest        file-5.txt      b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184 manitest        file-6.txt      b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184 manitest        file-9.txt      b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184 ",2

"Bulk Upload Applet Doesn't Work or Hangs on Multiple Browsers
From the last All Staff Retreat, I know this is a ""known"" issue. But, I wanted to track the scenarios that I've discovered thus far.  The Bulk Upload Applet responds in the following ways when loaded in the following environments: * Mac OSX (10.6.8) + Firefox 11.0 - Initially, saw a ""permanent"" hang. I had to kill Firefox to continue. However, after restarting Firefox, on second attempt it loaded almost immediately. * Mac OSX + Chrome 18.0 - Temporary hang (1-2 mins), eventually loads properly. * Mac OSX + Safari 5.1.5 - Loads almost immediately. * Windows 7 + Chrome 18.0 - Loads in about 20-30 seconds * Windows 7 + Firefox 12.0 - Applet never seems to load & I always see a ""blank"" pop-up window (just includes Duracloud header/footer)  UPDATE: Actually the issue was that the Java Plugin was disabled.

"Pie charts not visible on history line graph data point click
When an admin is logged in and looking at the space detail, the pie charts will display below the fold.  In order to see them, the user scrolls down.   However when the user clicks on a line chart data point, the pie graphs will be updated, but the user will not notice because they are not visible.   It would be much better if the history line chart would scroll to the top of its container when the line chart is clicked.",1

"Space Names with '--'
Currently, when using either duradmin or the durastore REST API directly, creating a space which includes '--' behaves unexpectedly. For example, create a space named: 'test--x--space'  It shows up in the space listing as expected. Then click the spaces tab, and it turns into: 'test-x-space'  Likewise, when creating similarly named space via the durastore REST API.  In both cases space shows up in the listing as well as in the AWS S3 Console as having a single '-'. It would appear as if the transformation of '--' into '-' is happening at the durastore level.  This task is to allow durastore to permit space names with '--'. ",1
"UI: Space count causes bit integrity notice to be removed
On spaces with a large number of content items, there is an ajax call made to perform the count of items in the background. This number is updated in the space properties as the count continues, and is eventually set to indicate the final number.   When a space has had a successful bit integrity run, a notice with a green background is displayed in the space properties, with a link to the results of the bit integrity run.  In situations where both of these occur (a large number of items, and a successful bit integrity run), the completion of the item count causes the space properties to be reloaded, which removes the notice about the bit integrity run. This task is to ensure that the bit integrity notice persists through the item count update.",1
"Delete space button available to user
When logged in with ""user"" role, space delete button is available/visible. After clicking to delete space, an error pop-up window appears that states ""space delete failed.""

See attached screenshot for error pop-up window.",1
"Bit Integrity Tools service: Create report on empty space
Currently the Bit Integrity Tools service, when run over a space with 0 content items, indicates a link to a report, but does not actually generate the report. This task is to ensure that a report is generated, even when no content items are in the space.",1
"UI: Remove image preview
Currently the image preview section of the UI displays an icon (with mountains) when either the Image Server is not on, or when the space is not publicly viewable. This tends to prompt lots of user questions around why they cannot view an preview. This is especially an issue for multi-tenant accounts, where the user is not able to start the Image Server or make their space publicly viewable. This task is to remove the image preview area of the content item display.",1
"Secondary storage providers should be Read-only via the Rest Api
As the synchronization of content between storage providers becomes automated (DURACLOUD-642), it becomes unnecessary for users to edit content in their secondary provider. In order to maintain an assurance that content remains consistent between providers, the ability for users to make changes at their secondary storage provider should be removed. They would still be able to view and download all content, but no add/update/delete operations would be allowed.  This task is to update the REST API to ensure that users with role user/admin/owner do not have write access to secondary stores.",3

The count used to consistently start at 1000+ or 1999+. 2. When the count completes, it very often restarts and performs the count a second time, always ending with the same result.",1
"SyncTool: Better handle periods of time when the DuraCloud instance is unavailable
Update the sync tool to be better able to handle periods of time where the instance has become unavailable. This is particularly important to allow the SyncTool to continue to run normally across DuraCloud instance upgrades.   A likely strategy is: When a transfer fails, check to see if the instance is available before doing a retry, if its not, then wait for ~5 min and try again. When the instance becomes available again, resume file transfers.",2
"UI: Display of content items names which include #. characters
If a content item with the name ""#.txt"" exists in a space, then when it is selected in the UI, the content detail will display for a moment, but will then act as if the spaces tab has been selected. It appears that both the hash and period characters need to be in the content ID, but other characters can be added and the behavior remains the same.",1

"SyncTool --dryrun
This improvement is to create a ""dryrun"" flag on the synctool.

A full list of options for these settings can be found with ""man logrotate"".",1
"Sync and Retrieval Tool metadata support
This task is to update the Sync Tool and Retrieval Tool to be able to handle content tags and metadata.

"Duplicate-on-Demand via Inspector/Executor flow
As noted in testing described here https://wiki.duraspace.org/x/8YzvAQ, the work of transferring very large numbers of files from one storage provider to another is not particularly well suited to hadoop. This task it to create an alternative content duplication method.  The requirements are as follows: - Must be able to move content from any provider to any other provider - Must be able to be deployed onto multiple server instances in order to share the load and speed up processing  It may be necessary for this to be a multi-step process. Perhaps something like: 1. Run a process with the source space and the number of instances that will be used for the job as parameters, and it splits up the work into an input file for each worker node. 2. Each worker node is spun up and initialized with the proper information to do the work, including their portion of the job, as defined in step 1. 3. After all nodes have completed step 2, a final process verifies the transfer by comparing the source and destination spaces.  The goals of this work: 1. Provide a method which can reliably transfer large numbers of content files from one provider to another. 2. Provide a starting point for the further work of developing a large file processing capability within DuraCloud that does not rely on Amazon EMR.",5
"Sync Tool: CPU Utilization
The Sync Tool, when run, tends to use a very large percentage of the CPU. As noted by SaaS4, running the Sync Tool continuously for 10 days kept the CPU on their server pegged at 100% the entire time.  It seems likely that the high CPU utilization is due to the constant generation of MD5 checksums for each file. This would be a particular issue when the file set contains a large number of very small files.  This task is to investigate the reason behind the heavy CPU usage. Ideally a fix could also be included.",2
"Sync Tool: Limit local logging
The Sync Tool currently generates three logs: complete.log, duracloud.log, and synctool.log. It was noted by the SaaS4 customer that these logs together took up an unnecessarily large amount of hard drive space. They noted that over 10 days, after pushing 500 Gb of data, the logs totaled around 300 Gb. This is clearly too much space consumed by logs.  This task is to limit the log outputs. This could include removing the complete.log, as well as ensuring that logs are cycled properly, so as to not consume more than a set amount of space.",2
"Sync Tool: Exclude list
This task is to allow for passing a list of files to the Sync Tool which should be ignored when performing a sync. The simple case is for the file to include one full path to a file per line. Any file in this list would not be pushed to DuraCloud. Directories in the list would be excluded as well, along with all files and subdirectories in each directory.  A more complex implementation would allow for using wildcards to indicate files that should not be included. The capabilities of rsync should be reviewed in order to determine the most convenient syntax for the exclusions.",2

"Java 7 support
This task is to transition DuraCloud to be built and run using Java 7. There are a few reasons for this transition:  1. Oracle has announced that Java 6 will hit end-of-life in Nov 2012 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html) 2. Java 7 has been available for over a year, and is becoming more prevalent 3. Java 7 has new capabilities. One specific need is the capability (in NIO) to read/write file creation, modification, and access timestamps 4. We need to support customer use of Java 7 with our client-side tools (e.g. sync tool)",3

This task is to create a utility which can loop through a set of directories and capture the timestamp information (Creation Date, Modified Date, Access Date) on each of the included files. That timestamp info should be written to a file (so that it can be archived locally) as well as written as metadata to each files's corresponding DuraCloud content item. (The expectation here being that the Sync Tool has already done the work of moving each file to DuraCloud.)  The capability to capture time stamp information was added to the NIO package in Java 7 (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/attribute/BasicFileAttributes.html), thus this utility will need to be built and run using Java 7.

There is currently no need for updates on administrative files, and dealing with all of the messages generated by admin file updates wastes effort.",1
"Sync Tool: Add option to not overwrite changed files
This task is to add an option to the Sync Tool which ensures that it does not overwrite any existing DuraCloud content. This means that when a file on the local file system, which has previously been added to DuraCloud, changes, it is not simply uploaded again.  There are a few choices that need to be made for this new feature to be added: 1. When a file already in DuraCloud changes on the file system, is the updated file transferred to DuraCloud or not. If so, the original file will likely need to be renamed to prevent collision. 2. How is the list of updated files communicated to the user. Are they printed to the console (stdout), or written to a file? Is this consistent between interactive mode and run-to-completion mode? 3. How does this feature impact the upload tool?  A comment from the State of North Carolina about how they envision this feature:  ""Our ideal upload tool would allow us to specify a local directory to update in the cloud, and the tool would then identify and upload new files (new files defined by file name and path), and alert us to any files that have changed (same file name and path but new checksum hash) and not upload the files that have changed (or upload them in a way that doesn't overwrite the files in the cloud).

"Download Multiple Items as a zip or tar archival file.
This feature sprung into my mind:  it is not driven by user requests, but it seemed that it would be very handy especially once we have a search index for listing content items.   The idea is that it might be useful to be able to download multiple content items in one zip archive.  This would be especially useful if one needed to extract a large number of small files. You could select items either based on a search query or a list of contentIds.  I was envisioning it would work both at the durastore as well as duradmin levels.  You would issue a request for an archive and immediately receive a handle.  One could optionally specify an email address. The handle would enable you to get the status of the request.  When the request is complete, if an email address had been specified,  the user would receive an email with a link to the download page.  Otherwise the download URI would be available via a status query using the request handle.  Once the archive had been downloaded and verified the user could then make a call to remove download site.  If no call was made after a standard expiration time, the download would be removed automatically.  Regarding limits: Initially the total size limit would be constrained by the available server side disk space.  Obviously this is not going to work for extremely large downloads, ie greater than 100 GBs.   ",5
"UI: Large bit integrity reports cannot be displayed
For spaces with a large amount of content, the UI option to view the service report in a nice table does not work. This option is presented in the UI on the green health check bar, as well as on the services tab. If the ""report"" link is selected for one of these large spaces, the UI brings up the white display box, then the user waits for a rather long time (while DurAdmin is attempting to read the entire report file into memory so that it can be displayed) and eventually an error is shown indicating that not enough memory is available.  To fix this, the size of the report file should be checked. If the size is over some reasonable threshold, the report link should perform a file download (of the raw report) rather than attempting to display the chart.",1

As the synchronization of content between storage providers becomes automated (DURACLOUD-642), it becomes unnecessary for users to edit content in their secondary provider. In order to maintain an assurance that content remains consistent between providers, the ability for users to make changes at their secondary storage provider should be removed. They would still be able to view and download all content, but no add/update/delete operations would be allowed.  This task is to update the DurAdmin UI to ensure that users with role user/admin/owner do not have write access to secondary stores.",2
"Message consumers disconnecting
This issue is that for a few different reasons the JMS connections which are used to listen to messages from the brokers hosted by DuraStore/DuraService can disconnect and cease to receive any messages. This has been recorded in the Duplicate on Change service, as seen in the stack traces in the attached file. This results in the Duplicate on Change service being rendered essentially useless. This is likely also to be the cause of similar issues where the Auditor stops recording changes in the audit log.",1
"Content properties are being overwritten when content stream changes.
When the content of an item changes locally and is resynced to duracloud, the custom metadata (properties and tags) are wiped out.  To reproduce follow these steps:   1. add a file using the upload applet 2. add a custom property and tag to the content item. 3. change the file on your local machine by adding text to the end of it. 4. resync it using the upload applet. 5. verify that the content metadata is no longer there.  Another symptom of this problem:  if you log in as userX on the initial content item creation and then login as userY when uploading the changed content item, notice ""creator"" property changes from userX to userY.

"UI: Check box near space name
In DurAdmin, each space name has to its left a checkbox. Users expect that selecting the check box will perform the same action as selecting the space name text. Instead, selecting the checkbox (of one space or more) brings up a multi-select display.  A user from UCAR/NCAR was recently caught by this issue, and could not understand why the listing of content items was not showing up until they contacted Carissa for assistance.  This task is to discover and implement an alternative to the current UI functionality described above which will be more easily understandable.  From Carissa: Three users within the past month have had the misunderstanding that selecting the checkbox next to a space name would then allow them to view their content. Each time I had to field either a support email or call and explain that they should *not* select the checkbox next to the space name to view the content, add content, edit content, etc. but that they should only click on the name to select/highlight the space to view the content.   Ideally either clicking directly on the checkbox or the space name will select the space (add the checkmark) and both actions will behave identically: they will display the content of the space with all the other associated actions. The two actions that we lose by doing this are the ""delete selected space"" and ""edit properties"" on the space level. I believe we should determine another way for those options to appear.",2
"Sync Tool: Hidden password option
This task is to provide an option for the Sync Tool which will allow users to supply their DuraCloud password in a way other than via the command line options. The reason this is an issue, is because the full command used to run the sync tool remains available in the process list of the machine on which the sync tool is running.  The suggested fix for this concern is to allow users to define an environment variable which contains their DuraCloud password, which would be picked up by the Sync Tool if the -p option is not provided.

"Ability to easily share links to DuraCloud content
There should be a simple way to share content that is stored in DuraCloud. Something like a ""share"" button/feature for spaces/content items that are stored in DuraCloud would likely work. Initially, this could just be for content in open spaces. This would keep users from having to manually find the storage URL for a content item and then find a way to share it. Instead, the user could be presented with a pop-up window that could be configured to send an email or, perhaps, generate some embeddable html code.  This feature would make DuraCloud a convenient platform for sharing large files that were otherwise difficult to share, as they are too large to email or pass around via IM.  This feature would be notionally very similar to Dropbox Links (https://www.dropbox.com/help/167/en).  ",2

I don't see anything obvious in any of the synctool log files to account for the error, and I can't read the status display from the synctool to tell if things are working despite the error, or if the train has gone off the tracks.  The errors persist across restarts.  I've tried it a couple of times now, including removing the contents of the log directory.  Reverting back to version 2.0.0 cleared up the problem.",2
"Use S3 bucket tags for system space properties and remove feature allowing users to set space properties.
The new Glacier storage provider brought back to light the missing ability in Amazon S3 to set properties at the bucket level. Up to this point, we have used a file in each bucket to store DuraCloud space properties, but this will not work in the Glacier model, as that file will be archived to Glacier along with all content.  As no current customers are making use of space properties, this issue can be resolved in two steps: 1. Make use of S3 bucket tags to store the properties generated by DuraStore for each space created 2. Remove the SetSpaceProperty feature  Step 2 is necessary because of the limitations of S3 bucket tags. Only 10 tags are allowed, none more than 256 characters. While it would be possible to allow for a very limited number of metadata/tags provided by the user using a limited character set, the fact that this feature is not currently in use suggests that it is simply not needed.",6
