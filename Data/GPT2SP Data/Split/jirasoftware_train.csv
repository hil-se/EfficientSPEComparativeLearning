"Generic webwork aliases may clash with other plugins
Some web work actions have commands that have very generic aliases, such as ""Update"", ""Move"" and ""Synch"" etc. These aliases have a good chance to clash with the action name or aliases used by other plugins.  These aliases should be given a name specific to the plugin, such as ""UpdateGreenHopperDropBoard""... Alternatively, the bang syntax can be used in place of command aliases, such as ""DropBoardAction!update"". In this case, there is no need to define aliases for commands. (However, still need to define alias as an empty String; otherwise, a NPE will be thrown when parsing the xml.)",5

"As a rapid board owner I would like to be able to have a column constraint for ""Issues, excluding Sub-Tasks""
(!) Testing Notes (!)  Q: What happens in the case with an issue that has a subtask not captured by the filter? A: (/) Nothing - the count is for parent issues and not sub-tasks, so the count will not be affected.  Q: Test to see this works with Stories Swimlane config, as well as Queries. A: (/) Still works, though it is less clear what the issue count refers to given that you do not see the parent issue in the column it is in.  Q: What about negative numbers? A: (/) They continue to not be allowed - same input controls for constraints as before.  Q: Is this customizable for individual constraints, or globally for all constraints? A: (/) For the whole board, not individual columns  Q: What if the last parent is removed from that column but it's subtasks remain? A: (/) The count drops to zero.  Q: What happens if there is no subtask issuetype? A: (/) Nothing - the count should not be affected by issues which do not exist  Q: What happens when there are quick filters active that filter out parent issues? What happens when there are quick filters active that filter out sub-task issues?
