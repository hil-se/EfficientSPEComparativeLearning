Creates a new project-based file (current behavior)  # Right-click on file system node in Project Explorer.

Unfortunately, we can not universally add this option to all possible untitled files, but for those derived from our editor classes, we propose to do the following:    # override the default behavior in AbstractDecoratedTextEditor.performSaveAs()  # For untitled files, pop up our own dialog asking is the user wishes to save on the file system or in a project (radio button selection). Depending on the choice, we can then pop up the correct subsequent Save As... dialog.

Also suggest that we could have the user ""remember this choice"" if they almost always want to do one or the other.",1

"Copy/Cut/Paste intermittently fails in editor
There is a very strange issue that has been happening to me since I started using Aptana Studio at version 3.0.2...Sometimes when I copy (or cut) some text from the editor and paste it somewhere else in the same or different file, Aptana will paste the last thing (or second to last, depending on how you look at it) instead of the most recent thing I just copied.    I thought maybe just my keyboard wasn't working, since I had never experienced something like that before. But then my co-worker (who is also using Aptana 3.0.3) asked me if I was experiencing copy/paste issues too. That's when I knew I wasn't the only one. We noticed that the times when he can't copy/paste is when Aptana is using up 100% of the CPU. So, not sure if there is another bug and this is just a side-afect, or if this is a bug that can be isolated.    I don't know how to replicate this. All I know is that it is happening at seemingly random times.    Update:    Some people have reported relief after unbinding the shortcut 'command + c' from 'copy' under Preferences/General/keys. Unbinding this shortcut resolved the issue of copy/paste randomly not working.

"Using XULRunner in Aptana
Hi friends,  i just upgraded my computers to the new ubuntu release and now i have some troubles with the XULRunner based parts of Aptana. In all new releases of all major Linux distributions the XULRunner packages are disabled because of some seriously security issues. I asked in the #ubuntu irc why the package is removed from the current version and they told me that. They forwarded me to the Mozilla Website where they wrote that sience Firefox 4 the XULRunner is disables be default because of this security issues. (1.9.2 is only for Firefox 3.*)    I know it's very much to ask, but i think it's a good idea if Aptana could run without the XULrunner. It's for advanced users not a big problem to reinstall the libs directly from the page, but if it's a mayor security rist, i think twice about that. And if i don't du that, the complete GIT integration is nut useable and i only got some error messages like that here:    {quote}  Unhandled event loop exception  No more handles [Unknown Mozilla path (MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME not set)]  {quote}    Here are the IRC logs  {quote}  (17:57:53) Leo Unglaub: hi, can someone please explain to me why the xulrunner ins available in natty, but in the new version not?

"PHP: Open Method (ala PDT) functionality
PDT has an ""Open Method"" that allows the user to navigate to any method/class in any PHP file in a project/workspace.  This makes it a lot easier to locate a particular method or browse methods when looking the right method to use.  The list of methods is filterable (find as you type) and allows wildcards ({{*}}) as well to allow more flexible method listings.    Now that Aptana Studio 3 conflicts with PDT so that PDT's editor no longer works properly, it would be great if Aptana Studio added this feature to further round out the workflow that was lost from PDT.    For reference, the ""Open Method"" feature in PDT is launched via the following shortcut by default: {{CTRL+SHIFT+M}}",1

"JavaScript Code Formatter: More options for Spaces - Parentheses
The JavaScript Code Formatter is nice, but it's missing a few key options for me to use it.    Specifically, there are only two options for Spaces - Parentheses (Before/After).    However, parentheses are used for multiple reasons - if, function declarations, function calls, etc.  My desired spacing for parentheses doesn't apply to all of these.    For example, if I set Before = 1 and After = 0, I get:  {code}  var a = function (b, c, d) { // BAD Don't want the space before function arguments here      alert (b + c + d); // BAD Don't want the space before invokation arguments here  }  var c = a ? 10 : 20;  var bb = {      ""a"": 1,      ""b"": 2,      ""c"": 3  };  for (var i = 0, j = 0; i < 8 && j >= 0; i++, --j) { // GOOD This space is good      alert (""(a "" + a + "",j "" + j + "")""); // BAD Don't want the space before invokation arguments here  }  if (xyz[1] >= 5) { // GOOD This space is good  {code}    If I set Before = 0 and After = 0, I get    {code}  var a = function(b, c, d) { // GOOD      alert(b + c + d); // GOOD  }  var c = a ? 10 : 20;  var bb = {      ""a"": 1,      ""b"": 2,      ""c"": 3  };    for(var i = 0, j = 0; i < 8 && j >= 0; i++, --j) { // BAD I want a space here      alert(""(a "" + a + "",j "" + j + "")""); // GOOD  }  if(xyz[1] >= 5) { // BAD I want a space here  {code}    If there were separate Parentheses rules for function arguments, function invocation, and for/if/etc clauses, it'd be much nicer.",20

"dynamic language selection (multi language support)
Hi friends,  i would be very nice if Aptana would support multiple (scripting) languages in one file. In the current aptana version a *.php file supports syntax highliting and auto completion for php source. In *.html files we have the support for HTML. But very often you have template files where the markup is mixed. I addet you an example as attachment.    In this example i have a .html file and the full html support, but the php code is not realy good readable and i have no support for php functions, ... .

"PHP Variable, Function and Class documentation requires a save before it appears in content assist with Build Participation.
When working on a php file in the editor any documentation that is done for variables, functions, and classes does not appear in the item's content entry. This is the case for both single line and multi line comments. I'm expecting this is an actual issue since the Javascript editor picks up new documentation and changes to existing documentation without requiring a save.    Steps to Reproduce:  1) In the php editor define a class in a php file.  {noformat}  class Bird{      function fly(){          echo ""I'm flying!"";      }  }  {noformat}  2) Check the content assist for the class, notice that no documentation is present.  3) Add a comment above the class. Use the multi-line documentation style.  {noformat}  /**   * A class for representing birds.   */  class Bird{      function fly(){          echo ""I'm flying!"";      }  }  {noformat}  4) Check the content assist for the class. Note whether or not there is documentation present.  5) Save the file  6) Check the content assist for the class. Note whether or not there is documentation present.    Actual Results: No documentation is present on step 4 but documentation is present on step 6.  Expected Results: Documentation is present on step 4.    The same also occurs with variables and functions.    On a possibly related note: Creating a TODO comment doesn't cause the todo icon (clipboard) to appear next to the line numbers until after saving when working with php. Like the above issue, the javascript editor picks up the todo immediately without requiring a save. If these two issues are separate entities I can open a new issue for the TODO tags in php.",20

"Behavior of JSLint validator options does not match those from JSLint.com
JSLint supports the addition of comments to the top of a JavaScript as a means of setting JSLint options.      The comment:    /\*jslint white:true\*/  instructs the validator to 'Tolerate messy white space', which more specifically should be set to 'true if strict whitespace rules should be ignored'.  (Full documentation of JSLint options here: http://www.jslint.com/lint.html#options)    However, in Aptana Studio the opposite is occurring.  So setting 'white' to true causes whitespace to become important, rather than be ignored as expected.    I've found that others have mentioned this behavior on Stack Overflow:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6893045/jslint-options-doesnt-seem-to-work-on-aptana-3  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8597253/problems-with-jslint-options-in-aptana-studio-3    I've also found the same reversed logic with: 'plusplus', 'undef', 'regexp', 'nomen', and 'newcap' (and there are likely others).  Other observations:    - the logic for 'sub' is correct    - 'continue' signals a 'Bad option' warning.    - 'eqeq' errors do not seem to be caught.  ",8

One suggestion is to reuse the existing pref page and instead have a table at the top with two checkbox columns, one for build and one for reconcile. A less-optimal solution is to have two separate lists, one for each type of interaction.    Perhaps we should say ""On Typing"" as opposed to ""Reconcile""? Perhaps that is more user-friendly?    Tasks:  * Change the pref page  * Add some methods/fields to the participants to mark them as validators  * Use a more sane preference key scheme to store the enable/disable  * Create a migration function to migrate the old pref keys to the new scheme  * Some build participants need to be unchangeable or hidden from the end user (like indexing)  ",40

"Research heap exception and excessive I/O during indexing JS
Some profiling has been done already which has identified that:    # A large number of strings/char[] are being held onto during indexing. I think it's safe to assume that's related to JS inferencing, but that will need to be confirmed. Once that is verified, we need to look into why that is happening.  # There are a huge number of disk writes occurring during JS inferencing. I confirmed this by re-indexing the referenced project with JS indexing on and off. We know the issue is coming from JS inferencing due to the fact that Index is not designed to support reads when doing lots of writes. We will need to determine how we can avoid or how we can minimize reading from the Index during inferencing.",20
"JS indexing stores duplicate user agents on properties and functions
While gathering stats on how JS indexing info is stored, I noticed that some properties and functions were quite large in the index (>4K). Looking at a few of these, I see that there is a large amount of user agent added to some of the entries and many of these are duplicates. So, we will need to switch over to using a set to contain user agent elements and user agent elements themselves will need equals and hashCode implementations",8
"Consider caching UserAgentElements used in JS indexing
During profiling of indexing for a large JS project, I noticed that we had a large number of allocations of UserAgentElements. There is a finite list of these, so we should be able to cache these instances, thus avoiding a large number of allocations and garbage collection steps.",8
"Consider using a special token to indicate that a given JS type or member should have all user agents associated with it
Given the number of user agents we attach with inferred types and members, we should use a custom tag to indicate that the item should have all user agents associated with it. Looking at a large method entry in the index, we could cut down one entry from 3359 to 2595, for example. This may not sound significant, but in the closure-library this could potentially shave off as much as 42MB from a 71MB index given the high number of property and function counts there. This, of course, would need to be verified and should be considered an upper maximum in file size reduction",8
"Consider improving the performance of StringUtil.join
During profiling I noticed a large number of calls to StringUtil.join. At times, this method appeared as a hot spot as well. I believe the current implementation can be improved by pre-allocating a char[] of the destination size followed by copying of the strings and delimiters into this array. This is similar to what StringBuilder is doing; however, we avoid a number of method calls and we have the advantage of knowing the resulting size a priori. Note that StringBuilder does allow the initial capacity to be defined. FWIW, I had made similar changes in ParseNode for the child arrays (replaced ArrayList with our own inline implementation) and this affected performance dramatically.",8
"Reduce number of refreshes in Git Index and reduce work done during refresh
Previously I thought we could entirely remove refreshes when files change inside a git connected project. Turns out that we couldn't but there are other things we can do:  - When we get resource change events, only update the changed files, don't do a full batch refresh.  - Don't call batch refreshes from some actions like deleting files/folder or moving files through our UI. The connected filewatcher on the repo should pick up a file event or two to the ""index"" file which will trigger a batch refresh.  - When we do refresh we call one process and then we spawn off 3 parallel jobs to each run another process to update our listings. We may be able to reduce the number of processes down to as low as one in most cases (or two in worst case).",8

"Character Encoding options broken, falsely reporting UTF-8
A well known issue with deploying Titanium projects to android that has existed for a long, long time is problems with the Android emulator requiring files to be UTF-8.    So naturally if you ran across the issue when using TiStudio, you would right click the files, go to properties and check your 'Text file encoding' was set to UTF08. It automatically chooses the option titled 'Inherited from container (UTF-8)'.    So according to Aptana/TiStudio, the file is set to UTF-8. Yet the android emulator is still throwing a wobbly over a non UTF-8 file.    I then opened the exact file in Coda (by panic.com) to find that every single one of the Titanium Studio files was in face set to ""Western (Mac OS Roman)"" and not UTF-8. I edited the files to UTF-8 via Coda and hey presto, the android project works. The same action in Aptana/TiStudio does not work, it leaves the files in their old encoding.    The bug here is quite simply that the Aptana text file encoding options for files dont change the file encoding at all. This has been present since at very least when Appcelerator bought out Titanium Studio.

Steps as listed here:    File > New File will create a new file.

The default name is fine.  # Go to the editor. Type a key and leave it unsaved.  # Re-focus the Project Explorer view. Press ""Undo"". The file copy will go away.

"JS inference infers the type of logical expressions to be Boolean incorrectly
A logical expression in JavaScript using the operators || or && returns one of its operands, not a boolean evaluation of them as might be expected in other languages.  Aptana 3.1.0.201202291203 incorrectly infers the type of a variable assigned to such an expression as Boolean without considering the type of its operands.  An example is the very common JS idiom for giving an argument a default value or type in the case that it is omitted when the function is called:    {code:JavaScript}  function foo (optionalString) {      optionalString = optionalString || """"; // if it's been left out, make sure it's a string.      /* do other stuff... */  }  {code}    Inference could deduce the type of a logical expression to be the union of the types of its operands, but in my experience, the actual desired type is always the type of the right operand if it isn't Boolean.",8
"Content assist, inference, and documentation languages lack expressions to explicitly relate types to identifiers
The languages defined for adding documentation that affects content assist (ScriptDoc, SDocML, JSCA JSON) have type expressions whose grammer is inadequate in cases where the type is not specifically known beforehand, but can reliably be deduced from parameters.  Consider the ES5 Object.create, which creates a new object with a prototype specified by its parameter:    {code:JavaScript}  foo = new KnowTypeWithDocumentedProperties;  bar = Object.create(foo);  {code}    In that case, bar will have the same properties as foo.  However, it is not possible to infer them from the (hypothetical future) documentation for the Object.create method because the documentation languages lack a way to express that the return type will be the same as one of the parameters.    Perhaps more common:    {code:JavaScript}  BaseClass.prototype.chainableMethod = function () {      /* do something... */      return this;  }    DerivedClass.prototype = new BaseClass;    exampleInstance = new DerivedClass;  exampleReturn = exampleInstance.chainableMethod();  {code}    It is currently impossible to express that chainableMethod returns the same type as the object that owns it.  At best, inference will be able to guess that exampleReturn is an instance of BaseClass.  If many types derive from BaseClass, this is a problem, since content assist will be unable to infer any of the subclass properties after the call to chainableMethod, and a chainable method's purpose is to conveniently call additional methods on the return value.    The following would be really maddening to document:    {code:JavaScript}  dojo.declare(""my.ClassName"", Superclass, {      constructor: function () { /* ... */ },      someProperty: /* ... */  });    instance = new my.ClassName;  {code}    All of the properties that should be inferred for instance are in the parameters to dojo.declare; some day, when the ScriptDoc tags for assigning class membership work for inference, it will be possible for dojo users to document the class, but it will still be difficult/impossible for the authors of dojo.declare to provide type information.    Rather than add special cases in the Aptana source to deal with each of these specifically (and add more as they appear), it is preferable to extend the documentation languages' type expressions to include operators or new tags capable of explicitly stating a type's relationship to an identifier.      Because inference from simple assignments is now working quite well, the simplest solution might be a 'typeof' operator in ScriptDoc/SDocML/JSCA type expressions whose operand is a JavaScript expression.  The same inference code that is now working would evaluate the provided expression in the context of the invocation where it's found to determine the return type.",13

"Use initialCapacity when generating collections in CollectionsUtil

However, this could cause more memory to be used than is needed to contain the items that will be added to them.

"Avoid unresponsiveness from auto-expanding outline levels on start-up (css files)
*Problem:* When re-opening Aptana with both Outline window and a long css file open in Editor window, Aptana automatically expands all css nodes in the Outline window. This makes the program unresponsive for several seconds, until it has finished expanding all nodes.    *Suggestion:* Preference option for default outline level by file type. Reopening Outline at same level as it was when closing.    *Aptana version:* Aptana Studio 3, build: 3.0.8.201201201658    *Operating system:* Windows 7 64bit, Mac OS X 10.6",3
"Typing in a PHP file collapses the outline when errors occur
Any syntax errors while typing takes the class out of the outline, and when the syntax issue is resolved it collapses the node down to the root.    Steps to reproduce:  1. Open a php file.  2. Enter the code:    {code}  	class Bird {  		public function fly(){  			echo ""I'm flying."";  		}  		public function dive(){  			echo ""watch out below!""  		}  	}  {code}    3. Enter ""public function peck"" inside of class Bird but do not finish the line.    Actual results:  Class Bird is pulled from the outline as it now has syntax errors. If those errors are removed Bird is added to the outline but is collapsed.    Expected results:  Class Bird should stay in the outline while functions are being written.",8

"Add support for union, intersection, and grouping operators to scope selectors
TextMate scope syntax supports '&', '|', and parenthesis to create more explicit scope selectors. Our current implementation supports ""descendant selector"", ',', and '-' (negative lookahead). In order to support these new operators, we will need to create a true parser. We should be able to use existing ISelectorNode (the AST nodes); however, there is a subtle difference between a descendant selector and the & operator. A descendant selector can match any segment from the current position within the scope to the end of the scope. The & operator is used for intersection, so it will need its own node type. Additionally, we will need a node for parenthesis to make it easier to reverse an AST back to source. We use the source for some types of equality testing.

"Convert CSS AST to a generalize tree structure
Our current CSS AST nodes do not make use of the parent-child relationship as implied by the IParseNode interface. Instead, collections of child nodes are placed into arrays/collections which hang off of node properties. This makes it difficult to apply a process to the tree as a whole. We will need to create a CSS node type that is used to as a collection of nodes. Then we can rely on child position to retrieve the elements that are now being placed in fields. Once this change is done, this will certainly impact code that relies on the current shape of the AST: formatting, folding, outline, etc.",13
"Unsupported CSS syntax in Google Closure library
During testing, I noticed that we have a number of error markers on the closure-library project. Digging deeper, I'm seeing non-standard syntax for Mozilla. As an example:    {code}  @-moz-document url-prefix() {    .g-section {      overflow: hidden;    }  }  {code}    The CSS parser fails at url-prefix() and error recovery seems to have trouble recovering for a while after that.    Another failure occurs with an equal sign within a function:    {code}  .goog-custom-button-disabled {    background-image: none !important;    opacity: 0.3;    -moz-opacity: 0.3;    filter: alpha(opacity=30);  }  {code}    And another occurs at the second colon in the filter property:    {code}  #t3 {      filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.DropShadow(color='#e7e7e7',          offX='2',offY='2');      box-shadow: 2px 2px 0 #e7e7e7;      -moz-box-shadow: 2px 2px 0 #e7e7e7;      -webkit-box-shadow: 2px 2px 0 #e7e7e7;  }  {code}",13

"Add command-line option to load the rubles sequentially
We should add a command-line option to allow for sequential loading of bundles. It would make testing much easier.    It could either be to load all bundles sequentially, or it could enforce a maximum number of bundles that can be loaded at a time (which I would set to 1), something like:    studio.loadBundlesSequentially, or studio.bundleLoadConcurrency    Note, I also believe BundleManager.loadBundle() does not properly respect the wait parameter. Unless you are unit testing, it does nothing. ",5
"Consider allowing binary data in Indexes
Our current indexing implementation allows for string data only to be written to the index. In order to take advantage of some more compressed and more performant data formats, we would need to allow binary data to be written. Note that supporting binary data directly would be a large change. Alternately, we could convert the binary data to an ASCII format, like base64, but in my opinion, the additional overhead of performing that conversion may defeat the benefit we would gain from using one of the binary formats directly. Another alternate might be to use a system next to indexing. That could be a separate file (or files) that contain the binary data where the entries in the index simply point to those files.",13

"Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling Can't be Turned off (reappears after restart)
I've just upgraded to the latest aptana release (3.1.1.201204131931) and immediately hitting cpu usage issues with the CPU jumping to 90%ish every few seconds corresponding to a refresh of the workspace every few seconds. So I guess on my system Aptana the option 'Refresh using Native hooks or polling' is polling rather than hooks as it happens regardless of whether or not I'm doing anything.    I've traced it down to the 'Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling' which is under the Workspace menu. If I turn it off, the system quietens down and all is fine.     However, on a restart, this 'option' has reselected itself meaning (I guess) that the option is not reading it's setting correctly from the options saved (or perhaps isn't getting saved to the file?)    So the bug I'm reporting here is the preference can't be set beyond a restart and, of course, like all preferences it should be.    A second bug I guess is quite why the refresh of the workspace uses so much CPU - my system has 8000 files on a fairly old machine so I'm guessing it's hitting limits on my machine (results will of course vary on other machines). I've commented on that before (in the forums) and it was all fine in version 3 until now. I'll repeat my guess that there is a very inefficient method involved in the refresh of the workspace that still hasn't been resolved.     Anyway - hopefully to replicate ...    Type Workspace in to the preferences and select Workspaces at the bottom to get the ""Refresh ... "" option. Unselect it. Restart the studio, go back to that preference and you'll (hopefully) see it selected again.    I've attached two images - the first when I deselected the option. The second when I restarted showing the option has been selected again.",8

"Placing plugin under dropins folder do not make him load under standalone Aptana Studio 3.1.1
After installing standalone Aptana Studio 3.1.1, plugin is not initialized after putting it into {{dropins}} folder.    To make clear, for Aptana Studio 3.0.9 standalone it was possible to place {{features}} and {{plugins}} folder of some plugin into the {{dropins}} folder and after that plugin loads automatically at studio startup. That is documented at [http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox_p2_Getting_Started#Supported_dropins_formats] and [http://www.venukb.com/2006/08/20/install-eclipse-plugins-the-easy-way/].    h3. To reproduce  # Download  [Regex Util|http://myregexp.com/eclipsePlugin.html] plugin. It is small and handy plugin and always worked with all Aptana versions.  # Under Aptana Studio 3.1.1 placing its files under {{dropins}} do not make it load. Error log is empty, and Aptana starts as usual, but... without Regex Util plugin.  # The same thing (placing plugin files under {{dropins}} folder) with Eclipse 3.7.2 (indigo) is ok. Plugin is loaded normally as usual.    Attached file {{configuration.log}} is log info from Help -> About Aptana Studio 3 -> Installation Details -> Configuration tab.",8
"Limit number of columns colored to improve performance
I found that limiting the number of StyleRanges used makes a huge difference in performance for minified JS files. A simple fix is to limit to not add any more ranges past the 200th column of any line in ThemingDamagerRepairer. there may be additional gains if we can reduce the number of ranges we generated (say skip ones that match the default fg/bg colors).",8
"Certain comments break PHP formatting

"Fix revert system
When we deploy a new Aptana (or Titanium) release, we deploy it to a new location each time on Amazon S3, or to the same location (but wiping the old contents) on download.appcelerator.com. It appears that the P2 system now requires the old update site to exist in order to be able to revert to the previous version.    Suggest that we use the ""mirror"" task to merge in the previous versions (though Chris has suggested their might be a different approach to use as well)    {code}  <p2.mirror source=""${p2.build.repo}"">  	<destination kind=""metadata"" location=""${p2.repo.location}"" compressed=""${p2.compress}"" name=""${p2.metadata.repo.name}"" />  	<destination kind=""artifact"" location=""${p2.repo.location}"" compressed=""${p2.compress}"" name=""${p2.artifact.repo.name}"" />  	<slicingoptions includeoptional=""false"" />  </p2.mirror>  {code}    So, when deploying 3.1.1, we merge in 3.1.0.    We can keep the repos to merge in on the build server (we do them as tagged builds now) and update those references as part of updating version #s. However, maybe there is a better way to automatically figure out where these repos to merge in live.    h3. Suggested Fix  # Upgrade the two deployment scripts (the bash one for Titanium Studio and the Ruby release one for Studio 3) to take a list of versions and merge those into a new repo  # Upload the new repo to the same location as before  # Test the combined version by installing Version A, upgrading to version B, and being able to revert to version A (assuming A & B are both versions on the update site)",20

"Incorrect caret position for ScriptDoc Autocompleted comment blocks in JS Editor
When inserting a ScriptDoc comment block (e.g. above a function statement), the autocompleted comment block contains an additional space after the {{\*}} character on the 2nd line, but the caret is positioned directly after the {{\*}} character.    As a comparison, Aptana's CSS and PHP editors both position the caret _after_ the additional space on the 2nd line of the ScriptDoc block.    Note: See attached image for more information",8

"Aptana ignores changes in .gitignore files.
Aptana ignores changes in .gitignore file. If I add names of changed files to .gitignore, aptana still markes them as dirty. Workspace refresh doesn't help. The only thing that helps is to stage files and then unstage them.    PS: Not sure, but as i remember this happens on Mac too.",8
"Files outside of projects do not get validated by jsLint
Since the last update to 2.0.1.201204132053-13042012205605, js files that are opened - and are not part of a Titanium project - do not get validated by jsLint. If you open a js file that is in a project and make an error, the error appears straight away.  The same is not true for files outside projects, they don't get validated at all.    h3. To Test    # Create a new JS file on your desktop. Ensure that JSLint validation is on in preferences  # Add the following content: \\  {code}  function test1() {    var a = 0;  var b = null;  var a = null;    }  {code}  # Drag the file from the desktop into the editor area of Studio to open it (or open it via the File menu or Local Filesystem node)  # In 3.0.9, you will be warned about the duplicate assignment of a.

"Add support for @-moz-document to the CSS outline
Create a new CSS file and use the following content:    {code}  @-moz-document url-prefix() {    .g-section {      overflow: hidden;    }  }  {code}    Open the outline view and you will see an entry for @-moz-document. This is a new node type and as such, it does not have an icon. We also probably want to show only ""@-moz-document"" as the label. It looks like the children may need icons as well",8
"Add support for formatting of @-moz-document in CSS
Create a new empty CSS file and add the following content:    {code}  @-moz-document url-prefix() {    .g-section {      overflow: hidden;    }  }  {code}    Format the file. This results in:    {code}  @-moz-document url-prefix() {  .g-section {  overflow: hidden;  }  }  {code}    @-moz-document is a new node type (as well as CSSList). The formatter will need to support these nodes types as well.",8
"Task markers should be recognized on word boundaries only
It looks like our current task detection mechanism looks for raw strings instead of looking for words. For example, if I have the following in a JS file:    {code:js}  // TODOC: document this  var xyz = 10;  {code}    We show a TODO task for that comment. I verified in JDT and they recognize whole words. We should do the same.",3
"Building workspace hangs forever on file save
After updating to Aptana Studio 3, build: 3.1.1.201204131931, I immediately started experiencing the issue where ""Building workspace"" would hang forever upon each file save.  A particular file I was editing was a PHP file (.php) and/or a PHP template file (.tpl).  Unfortunately, before ""Building workspace"" operation is completed, I am not able to save the file.  Since the mentioned operation never completes, the files in the Editor will never get saved.  I've checked ""[x] Save automatically before build"" in Workspace preferences, and it lets me save the file first time, but consequent saves fail since the ""Building workspace"" operation occurs right after file save and is stuck indefinitely.    Attached is the screens shot demonstrating the issue.",8
"PHP constants defined in define() statements outside of a class, but included, cannot be CTRL-clicked to locate the source of the definition
I used to work with Zend Studio where it was possible to go to the definition for constants using hyper-linking ""ctrl+click"" (as for functions, vars, etc.) I switched to Aptana studio 3.0 and customized my way well except on this point. Does anyone knows if it's possible to manage PHP constants in Aptana the same way as with Zend Studio?  Originally from StackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8658594/move-to-the-definition-for-php-constants-in-aptana    Steps to reproduce:  1. Create two php files in the same PHP project:  {code}  File a.php:  <?php  class TestClass {  const TEST_CONST1 = 0;  const TEST_CONST2 = -1;  const TEST_CONST3 = 5;  const TEST_CONST4 = -5;  }    File b.php:  <?php  TestClass::TEST_CONST1;  {code}    2. Hold Ctrl and hovering over the TEST_CONST1 in b.php.  3. Click link.     Actual result: No link appears.  Expected Result: Clicking that link opens a.php on line 3.",8

"Improve behavior for validating JIRA login
When validating the user's credentials for the JIRA login, clicking Validate behaves a little odd: the Validate button stays blue, and then a couple seconds later we get a beach ball.    * Maybe we need to run the process outside the UI and then react when we get the result?  * Also, the error message when it fails is a little obtuse since it shows the exception name - we can probably handle the specific case of bad credentials with a custom message?  * Once we've validated the user's information, we should remove the username/password field",8
