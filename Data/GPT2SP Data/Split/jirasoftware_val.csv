"As a user, I'd like the existing fields included by default in the detail view to be configurable like for custom fields
COS:  - Upgrade task  - All the existing fields on the detail tab of the detail view in the same order they are there atm  - Newly created boards should have the default set up    NOTE: We should lock the Rapid View when an upgrade is in progress.    (!) Development Notes (!)    Q: What if one of these fields does not exist?  A: (/) Not possible to delete, but you can hide the field. It is not visible on detail view, but its listed on the detail view configuration.    Q: What if one of these fields has been renamed?  A: (/) No rename option available for system fields    Q: What if there is a custom field named with same name?  A: (/) No special handling in this case - works as expected.    Q: Is there any difference for in-line editable fields vs non-editable?  A: (/) We are only doing this for fields in Detail Section    Q: What happens if you remove a default field after the upgrade task?  A: (/) Its not possible to delete system fields from JIRA    Q: This needs to be tested on all databases.  A: (/) OK    Q: What older versions of the data do we need to be wary of? What about pre- Detail View data?  A: (/) Should be handled automatically by AO staff    Q: What if fields are not in the expected order?  A: (/) The order in this case does not matter -   we will add those fields which are not already present there.      ",8
"Allow JQL for searching for all issues in an Epic via their ""epic label""

Testing Notes (!)    Q: What if there are epics with duplicate names (either globally or within the search scope)?  A: (/) They will all match so the issues list will be an union of all the issues of those matching epics    Q: What if the epic is closed/resolved?

"Simplified Workflow button fails with ""Workflow Migration did not complete successfully"" can be improved
(!) Testing Notes (!) Q: Who has permission to simplify the workflow? Board owner or admin? A: (/) Admin or Sys Admin  Q: If board owner is allowed, what if they don't have permissions to edit the workflow of the project? A: N/A  Q: What if a simplified workflow already exists for this project? A: Dialog prompt is not given.  Q: What about the resolve screen or modal dialogs from the last workflow? A: All screens from previous workflow are removed.  Q: What will happen if the user is logged out/migration is interrupted during migration? A: We now make one call to the server via REST, to both create the new (simplified) workflow scheme and to kick off the migration of the workflow.  Q: What if an issue is being transitioned during migration? A: Whatever happens in JIRA will happen here.  Q: What if the user's security token is expired? A: The XSRF token will no longer be used in this operation.  Q: What if the board filter is changed to include multiple projects when at the workflow migration dialog? A: I'm assuming it will fail with an error.   # Deploying a fresh *JIRA 5.0.7* instance equipped with *GreenHopper 6.0.2*, tried to enable the *Simplify Workflow* button but it failed with the following error: !migrate_failed.JPG!  # After that, authenticate as a user with the Administrator Access: !admin_access.JPG!  # After that, the workflow migration works fine: !migrate_success.JPG!

"Allow the detail view to be closed on plan mode
COS:  - What does this look like without the ""Epics"" column? - The whole plan mode just goes across the screen    Scenarios / Requirements    * Behaviour in plan and work mode should now be more consistent ...   * Plan and Work mode details are independent, i.e. when opening issue A in Plan and issue B in Work, flicking between the two should preserve the open issues.   * Opening and closing details in plan and work mode are independent, i.e. closing detail in plan mode should not close it in work mode and vice versa.  * On initial load, the backlog will fill the screen - the plan mode content block is gone for good.   * Deselecting an issue in plan mode has the same effect as closing it.   * Clicking on an issue in plan mode now just selects it and no longer opens the issue detail. However if it's already opened then it will refresh to the currently selected issue (same behaviour as work mode).  * If a filter is applied and the selected issue is filtered out then issue detail is closed.   * Multi-select - if issue detail is open, display the last selected issue. If it's closed, don't open it.       (!) Testing Notes (!)    Q: What if an inline edit is open?  A: Changes should be saved and then detail closed.     Q: Will it have an XBox™ to close akin to work mode?  A: Oui    Q: What if there is an error in plan mode when you try to close it?  A: It should not close until the error is fixed.   Example: Edit the estimate and put some letters in the field (not allowed) - currently the error appears inline, then on close appears at the top.     Q: Do the cards resize nicely without detail view?  A: They will stretch across the page    Q: Same keyboard shortcut? If so, is there any collision with S + T?  A: Shortcut will be T. ST should rank the issue without showing the issue detail if it's not open. If it is, ST selects the next issue that was below the one that moved so this would then appear in the detail view.     Q: How performant is it with thousands of issues?  A: (x) Not Answered No idea yet.",3
"As a user, I'd like to inline edit sprint name, start and end date at the top of plan mode so that KA styles make sense
COS:  - Dates will split to two edits - Dates will behave like existing inline edit in work mode dialog - When you edit the name you'll just be editing the name inline  (!) Testing Notes (!) Q: What happens when clicking between open inline edits? A: Clicking from a name to a date picker will submit the name (if changed) and activate the edit for the date picker. Clicking between date pickers will change the currently edited date picker, as choosing a new date will automatically stop editing after the new date is saved.  If there is an error in a field, clicking away from the field will not keep the field in edit mode.  Q: Are foreign date formats properly supported? A: Tested with Swedish locale - there is still the AM/PM time code, but that is a JIRA issue.  Q: Inline edit works in all browsers? A: (x) Not Answered",2

"Restrict editing of the Sprint CF to users with Schedule permission for that issue
This is something I found randomly and I guess it makes sense for us to check. I tried this on a clean installation and reproduced many times in different ways. In a nutshell, I think the shortest path to demonstrate is the following:    # Let us say I have a project named _ABC_ and a Rapid Board _ABC Board_ containing issues from that project.  # I also have two users:  ## charlie: All permissions on project ABC  ## alpha: Only in jira-users, essentially only able to create issues in ABC (user has been added specifically in this example but it would work for him anyway):  !1-alphagroups.png!  !2-createissues.png!  # Project roles in ABC are like the following:  !3-people.png!  # charlie creates ABC-1:  !4-create.png!  # Then charlie adds ABC-1 to Sprint 1 (just created by him, also):  !5-plan.png!  # The sprint id for that sprint is 1 (the address bar is from the sprint report):  !6-sprintId.png!  # The Sprint field is also visible on all screens:  !7-sprintfield.png!  # Now user _alpha_ tries to create an issue in JIRA. Remember that he cannot even browse project ABC but he can edit the Sprint Field and add the sprint id (1, in this case):  !8-alphacreatesissue.png!  # ... so when he tries to view ABC-2 he cannot:  !9-permissionviolation.png!  # However, ABC-2 has been added to the sprint:  !10-issueadded.png!

"Add Epic Label to the Create Issue Screen in JIRA config so it will show up in the Epic Quick Create dialog
(!) Testing Notes (!) Q: What happens if this field is deleted/removed from the screen? A: It won't appear on the screen.  Q: What if it is renamed? A: In theory, it should just display with the new name but atm, GH blows up and disables itself. See subtask GHS-6162.   Q: What if the field's permissions are modified? A: It doesn't show up.   Further testing notes: - the field is added to the screen for the create issue operation for the epic issue type - it's not added to screens within an issue type screen scheme that is not associated to any projects - if there is a specific screen scheme for epics, it's only added to those screens - otherwise screens within the default scheme",1

Clipping or ellipsis would not help much. We can fit 5 digit numbers before this occurs.    Q: What happens when the nav items exceed the available space?

As we use the voting facility of JIRA/Greenhopper to get a guideline when ordering/ranking the backlog in Planning mode in the agile board, we would love to see the number of votes on the agile board (only planning mode).  For this prupose we could go into two directions: * display the number of votes in all cards in the backlog (configurable?) * display the number of votes in the detail view of the agile board.  The latter is acceptable and probably easier to get.  We recommend put this in the People section of the Info area.  We'll link the tally directly to the voters page just as JIRA View Issue does.",1
