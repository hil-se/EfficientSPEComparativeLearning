"Add diagnostic tests for troubleshooting npm configuration issues
If any user has npm installation issues either with or without prefix configured, then it might not be very easy to judge the problem on the user's machine, especially with npm prefix configuration.    Instead of asking user each time to run a series of commands on their machine to figure out the underlying problem, we can add those commands in the diagnostic tests and that should let us give a fair idea on what is going on user's machine with just the diagnostic test logs.    When the NPM updates are invoked, either during startup or by the user -    1) It verifies whether the package is installed on the machine using 'npm -g ls <package>' command.  1.1) If the above command fails for any reason, then invokes 'npm -p ls -g'  2) If the package is available on the machine, it figures out the installed version and latest available version using 'npm view <package> version' command.    Also, since PREFIX is one of those dark areas, we need to add the prefix configuration to the diagnostic logs.    1) Environment variable : Get the system property for NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX  2) Get the prefix key from the npm configuration : npm config get prefix  3) If only the environment variable is set, then the local prefix config value differs from the global one. That can lead to discrepancies in the installation of npm packages. So we should get the output for : 'sudo npm config get prefix'. However, since we don't hold user's password, this might not be a feasible value to store in the diagnostic tests.",5

If a given component is required, we should not allow the user to dismiss the install - thus helping to avoid invalid setups because user's didn't accept.

"Studio freezes if the user enter only credentials without proxy settings after logout from proxy
This is an edge case where the Studio freezes if the proxy details are already saved in preferences, but user logs out in the previous session. Steps to reproduce :    1) Login into Studio and set proxy server details.  2) Now, logout from Studio.  3) In the login screen, enter only user login credentials (the proxy server details are not shown in the proxy dialog, though they are saved in the preferences).  4) Studio prompts for proxy user id & pwd. If the details are not submitted before the dashboard is opened, then Studio freezes.    Workaround : Restarting Studio will help fix this problem.    Ideally, we should load the proxy server preferences during the login screen of splash handlers. Since we didn't load any of the proxy details, we didn't end up with setting the simple proxy authenticator, thereby Eclipse prompts to enter the proxy user id/pwd. Since dashboard also tries to make network connection at the same time, it end up in a deadlock.",3

"Remove the blackberry device settings from preferences page
Steps to reproduce :    1) Configure the BlackBerry device settings such as Device IP, password and debug token in the preferences.  2) Launch an app on BlackBerry device - It prompts a dialog with the configured BlackBerry device settings and they are automatically saved to the launch configuration.  3) Change the password on the device, or get a new device with a different password - then it is more likely that user will update the preferences with the new device password.  4) Run the same app on BlackBerry device assuming that the new password is updated in the preferences.    The launch will fail with authentication problem as launch configuration still references to the old password, though the new password is updated in the preference.    In order to fix this problem and to avoid confusion with passwords stored in multiple locations, we should not have the settings saved in the launch configuration. Every time an app is launched on BlackBerry device, we need to get the updated device settings from the preference.",5

"Android: Keystore - When creating a new Android keystore, there should be a drop down list to select the different signature algorithm
*Details:* Depending on which Java version is being used by the machine, there should be a drop down list as to which signature algorithm should be used when creating an Android keystore.    For instance, Java 1.6.X only ships with SHA1withRSA, so there should be a signature drop down list that has only SHA1withRSA selected.    Java 1.7.X ships both SHA1withRSA and SHA256withRSA, so there should be a signature drop down list for both signatures.    By having this option when creating an Android keystore, a user can:     1. Package their app to a non-KitKat (< 4.4) device using only the SHA1withRSA signature  2. Package their app to a KitKat device with either SHA1withRSA *or* SHA256withRSA. ",5

"Allow navigation between Alloy files under a hierarchical structure
A suggestion from a user in TISTUD-3295:    I have one suggestion that can cover one use case that is being missed by this feature. In our app/controller folder, we have a hierarchical structure that organizes our controllers in a logical fashion. For instance, we have the following:    app/  app/assets/  app/controllers/  app/controllers/file1.js  app/controllers/file2.js  app/controllers/file3.js  app/controllers/file4.js  app/controllers/file5.js  app/controllers/templates/another_controller1.js  app/controllers/templates/another_controller2.js  app/controllers/templates/another_controller3.js  app/controllers/templates/another_controller4.js  lib/  lib/...  ...    The same controller structure is mirrored for the styles and the views.    Now, when you open a controller, style or view that is not directly sitting in the folders app/controllers/, app/styles/ or app/views/, then you will not be able to use the new simplified navigation to open the other related files. The option will be greyed out.    It would be nice to have that use case supported.  ",8

"Studio: Cannot change alias for Android app publication
Trying to publish an app in the Play market.    There must be a bug in the Studio that makes you cannot CHANGE the alias in the alias field on the Run Configurations once it is launch the first time (well, you can change it, but it recovers the first name you wrote the first time because the Apply button is not enabled to save it, see screenshot).    In my case I wrote a BAD alias that launched the next error:   {code}  For help, run: titanium help build    [ERROR] Missing required option: --alias <alias>  {code}  To fix it, I deleted the configuration and I created a new one, with the right alias name.

"Allow selecting the base repo and branch for a pull request
We allow generating Pull Requests from a forked repo. It currently assumes a lot and I'm bumping against the limitations now. It assumes that the current branch is the ""compare"" on the current repo. That seems fine to keep. The problem is that we can't change the base, which is hard-coded to be the parent repo (that the fork came off of) and that repo's default branch.    At the very least we should allow selecting the base branch. Ideally we'd also allow changing the base repo to any repo in the network of forks.",8
"Studio Formatter behaves incorrectly causing JSHint errors
I have noticed that the formatter used within the Studio application has a number of issues that are causing me and my team a lot of difficulties when working with different tools and attempting to maintain a high level of code quality.    1. Studio reformats functions and var declarations within functions incorrectly. I say incorrect as it can cause JSHint errors afterwards also existing formatting applied, say by developer A, gets reformatted by Studio when developer B edits the documents.    Here is an example of a small function example that has been formatted with Sublime Text 2 and passes JSHint. It is also the style that I wish to use, which also is recommended in many books regarding code quality with JavaScript.    {code:title=FormattingCorrect.js|borderStyle=solid}  /**   * Test File for Appcelerator Studio Formatting Bug   *   * @author Ketan Majmudar   */    /**   * Example Function that maintains a space after the function parantheses and the braces.   * variable declaration within is indented for readibility and also allows for git merges   * to be easily reviewed. The   *   * ""use strict""; is used internally and is another issue when the Studio foramtter is used,   *  it throws errors when using JSLint and should respect certain code style guide conventions.   *   */    function exampleFunction() {      ""use strict"";      var myVar1,          myVar2,          myVar3;        switch (myVar1) {      case true:          myVar3 = true;          break;      case false:          myVar3 = false;          break;      default:          myVar3 = null;      }      Ti.API.log(myVar1 + myVar2 + myVar3);  }    exports.exampleFunction = exampleFunction;  {code}    If this is copy/pasted into Studio, and you use the Source Format option, by default or with custom settings, a few things happen that break the styling and flow.    The ""use strict""; statement is placed immediately to the right of the opening brace, the variables are all moved onto a single line, and switch statements re-indent themselves.    This is very frustrating when you are working on multiple branches of a project and the commits are going back and forth due to formatting changes made by the product. Take a look at what Studio does to the code example:    {code:title=FormattingBroken.js|borderStyle=solid}  /**   * Test File for Appcelerator Studio Formatting Bug   *   * @author Ketan Majmudar   */    /**   * Example Function that maintains a space after the function parantheses and the braces.   * variable declaration within is indented for readibility and also allows for git merges   * to be easily reviewed. The   *   * ""use strict""; is used internally and is another issue when the Studio foramtter is used,   *  it throws errors when using JSLint and should respect certain code style guide conventions.   *   */    function exampleFunction() {""use strict"";      var myVar1, myVar2, myVar3;        switch (myVar1) {          case true:              myVar3 = true;              break;          case false:              myVar3 = false;              break;          default:              myVar3 = null;      }      Ti.API.log(myVar1 + myVar2 + myVar3);  }    exports.exampleFunction = exampleFunction;  {code}    The case should be indented with the switch, the vars should stay on a newline and the ""use strict""; should not move.    This raises a wider question as why we can't use JSBeautifer rules/tags for certain settings. The formatting options and rules probably would better serve us if they adopted more of this standard approach that is more widely adopted. (just an idea).    My main issue is this current reformatting.    Key Issues that need to be addressed:  * ""use strict""; should not reflow immediately after the brace  * var declarations on newlines should not all be placed on a single line  * switch statements should not indent cases.",9

"After building, Studio is still showing 'Launching delegate' in progress
h5. Problem description  After building an application, it could happen that the app is built and runs fine, but Appc-Studio seems to be still doing something in the background - specifically, ‘Launching delegate’, displaying an ongoing activity in the bottom-right corner, staying stuck at 57%.    h5.

However, in the bottom-right corner of Studio, there is an ongoing process (see Screen Shot 2014-05-28).   Expected result: Studio should show no ongoing process.    2. Click on the bottom-right progress bar  Result:  Progress window is displayed, showing details on the ongoing process (""Launching delegate"" progress information is shown).

Perform further actions on the app project (build, clean workspace etc...)  Result: It is actually possible then to do everything (build, clean workspaces etc…).    It seems Studio is not really hang in there, but it shows to stay in the state as shown in the screenshots.  So far has been reproduced when building/running an App on iOS device.    h5.
