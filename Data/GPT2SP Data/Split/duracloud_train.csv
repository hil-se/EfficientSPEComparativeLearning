Amazon S3 limits files size to 5GB, but many of our customers will want to store files larger than this.

"Limit count of space items in space metadata
The current call to get space metadata performs a count of the number of items in a space. For S3, this requires getting a list of the entire set of content and counting the included items. When there is a large number of item in the space, this can take quite a while (around 4 minutes for 250,000 objects). Rather than performing this count every time the metadata is requested for a space, the count should be capped and a value returned which indicates that there is a large number of objects. As an example, if the cap for counting is 1000 items, a value of ""1000+"" could be returned when the cap is reached.  Along with this cap, there needs to be a way to get the actual content count. This would likely work best as a client-side count, since the client would be able to update its display to indicate that the count is proceeding.",1

"Investigate sojo dependency
Hello Danny, I have noticed there have been a couple of build failures due to a new dependency of duradmin that apparently is not always available from its hosting maven repository, namely, net.sf.sojo:sojo-optional:jar:0.5.0. It looks like this is a transitive dependency that was pulled in recently through: net.sf.spring-json:spring-json:jar:1.3.0.  Would you be able to do some testing to see if duradmin actually needs this dependency or not. If we do need it, then we can pull it into our own Duraspace maven repository. Since it probably is a runtime dependency with the AJAX tooling, could you remove it from your local maven repository, place an exclude element in your duradmin pom.xml, and run through the application to see if it is actually being used anywhere? ...and naturally double check you local repository to make sure it did not slip back in.  Thanks, Andrew  p.s. I am planning on putting up a new page/form in duradmin that allows for showing/adding/removing/updating security users. Once the initial page is in the baseline, could you go through and make it usable and presentable? We can talk at length later. ",1

"Handle XML in a consistent way throughout the DuraCloud baseline
DuraCloud currently uses XML in many places and there are serveral tools and methods used for validating and parsing the XML into an object model. The first step is to pull each bit of XML generation/parsing/validating code into its own class, passing back objects that can be used by the other parts of the code. This will make it easier to re-factor the XML handling into a standard method.  We should consider which tool(s) provides the best set of features and use it consistently. We should also have a standard method for validation, Relax NG should be considered here.",5
"Error viewing files in DurAdmin space listing
To replicate: Add the attached file (which includes a + in the file name) to a space. View the space using DurAdmin. The request appears to fail to get metadata for the new file, so its link is removed and replaced with: Unable to complete request: status (200)  If you click on the link before it disappears, everything appears as it should, the metadata is displayed, and the file can be viewed or downloaded.  Note that this problem appears to occur when any of these characters show up in the contentID: +,"", #, %, &  So a couple of questions here: - What's causing the failure when retrieving metadata? - Why does the link to the item disappear when the metadata can't be retrieved?  As a side note, if you select a content item to view on the space page before the metadata for all content items has loaded, all content items in the list turn into error messages. The content page loads shortly after this, so things get back to normal, but it may appear to a user that they have done something wrong by clicking on a content link.",2

"Create file-based credential store for unit tests
Replace the current unit-test-db with a file-based method for storing and retrieving storage provider credentials. This new method will need to be able to handle storage files which are and which are not encrypted.   - Developers should be able to keep a local file (perhaps pointed to by maven settings) which includes all of the account credentials needed for testing. They should be able to choose to encrypt this file or not. Working with an unencrypted file is simpler for local development. Using an encrypted file will allow for more secure storage and for simpler sharing among developers. (The key needed to enc/dec could be stored in maven settings as it is now for the db.) - We may choose to pass an encryped credentials file into bamboo in order to be able to update the test accounts (and keys) without needing to rebuild the AMI.  It seems likely that we can reuse the code in app-config to actually read the credentials file, assuming the same format as an app-config file. We should also be able to use the EncryptionUtil in common to handle the encryption/decryption (in combination with Commons-IO FileUtils.readFileToString()).

When the number of content items within a space exceeds 1000 and the ""maxResults"" parameter is set to 1000 or greater (1000 is the default), then ContentIterator.java eventually terminates early. This is because the underlying query to the storage provider is maxResults+1 to account for the possibility that the space metadata content object may be in the listing. Since the S3 client will only return a max of 1000 items regardless of the maxResults parameter, the call with 1001 effectively turns into a call for 1000 items. The logic in ContentIterator is terminating if the number of items in the listing returned is less than the maxResults parameter, which is the case when 1000 items are returned and one is removed (i.e. the space metadata object).",1

I think the retrieval tool is missing an option where you can retrieve specific file(s) from a specific space.

I would like to be able to request specific files by name (or by a comma separated list of names).  A regular expression could also work, but a list of exact names would seemingly meet the needs for DSpace. So, for DSpace, the AIP files stored in DuraCloud will have very specific names, similar to:  COLLECTION@123456789-10.zip ITEM@123456789-11.zip  Generally the AIP name is a specific format: <DSpace-Object-Type>@<DSpace-Object-identifier>.zip  So, if a DSpace install wanted to restore just a particular object (or small set of objects), it might be nice if they can request *just* those objects by name (rather than having to pull down their entire space).

This task is to provide a visual cue to help distinguish between providers.   One potential way to do this would be for each storage provider to correspond with a different color, and that color be displayed prominently (perhaps even as the spaces area background) when that provider is selected.",4

A small percentage of files are not copied during the execution of a large Duplicate on Demand service execution.  This can result in either a missing file or a zero length file in the target space.  This has bug has been demonstrated repeatedly both between different providers and copies back to the same provider.  However, it has only been observed in large file sets (circa 70,000).",16
"Use Amazon multi-part upload for large files
This task is to update the S3StorageProvider to make use of Amazon's multi-part upload option for S3 when content is large enough to require chunking. This would mean that rather than storing our chunked file parts (and associated manifest) in S3, we would use the multi-part tools to push up the pieces and assemble them again in S3.  Since the MD5 for the entire chunked file is not available from S3, we will need to calculate it on transfer and store it as metadata.",5
"Implement a content cache to mitigate eventual consistency issues
In order to make the issues of eventual consistency an issue that does not concern the users of DuraCloud, DuraStore should be updated to provide a cache for the content which is stored. This could mean either storing the file locally first, then making the call to push it to the provider, or wrapping the stream in order to write the file locally while it is being stored at the provider. These local files would be used to fulfill GET requests that come in shortly after the file has been stored. The files in the cache would be removed once there is a greater degree of certainty that the file will be available on all following requests to the provider (perhaps just after a certain time period has elapsed.)  Note that one benefit to storing the files locally prior to pushing them to the provider would be that we could know the file size and generate the checksum locally before making the provider request, meaning that we could ensure that the file reached DuraStore correctly before passing it along to the next location. This may also become useful for handling large files that we intend to pass to the provider using a multi-part upload.",5

This task is to create a client-side tool which provides a nice user interface for managing bulk upload tasks.  This tool should provide a UI that allows files to be uploaded via the following methods: - file/directory selection dialog  A progress bar should be provided which indicates the status of the upload, specifying which file is being uploaded and the progress of the transfer.

It is expected that the interface will allow them to create ""sub-folders"" or spaces within spaces, etc. that will map to the local directories that the content was stored in.  This task is to update the display of content items such that the user sees the commonly expected folder structure, which allows navigation down to files. This should look pretty similar to the display provided for content in S3 by the AWS console.",8

It characterizes the performance of the system under various load scenarios. It is also a primary input for bottleneck analysis that can be used to improve system performance. Performance tests often overlap functional tests and are useful for ensuring that DuraCloud is functioning as documented. Performance testing is also used to help size and manage the operating infrastructure in order to avoid unnecessary costs. These costs are part of the information needed to set the price of our services.",5

This feature is to create a UI in duradmin for managing space-level ACLs. It will likely be a button in the righthand pane, similar to the ""edit"" button for space metadata. The functionality should enable Admins to add/remove 'users' and/or 'groups' to the space ACL with permissions of 'read' or 'write' (which implies read). A potentially attractive UI widget would be the one that renders two, side-by-side boxes containing usernames, and arrows allowing the moving of usernames from one box to the other. ",3
