"Allows CVS repo to timeout and report on locking issues
Sometimes, when you perform a CVS action you get something like    {noformat}  cvs update: [01:38:32] waiting for mchai's lock in /cvsroot/atlassian/maven2test/bamboo  {noformat}    so Bamboo would probably just hang and become not so happy. We should allow Bamboo to timeout, or conditionally stop and tell the user how to dix the problem",3

There were two problems:  * Bamboo did bump up build number and this build failed, but nowhere it was really shown. I.e. on dashboard (and via remote API) I still got last build as successful. And although my build number (in above logs) was now greater than 1000, Bamboo claimed on dashboard and via API that the last build is e.g. 500 (which happened to be the last one before these problems started)  * Cleaning working dir or full checkout did not help  * I solved this problem by full clean and using anonymous SVN access or my private account. Only then Bamboo finally showed new build on dashboard (with number > 1000) and its real status.    I suspect the problem may be also somehow connected to our SVN server which could have applied some security policies to avoid DOS attacks from Bamboo (Bamboo every 3 minutes - above 500 hundred times) was trying to checkout from svn the sources without success.

h3. Case A    Consider a series of builds:    BUILD-1  Test X passed  BUILD-2  Test X failed  BUILD-3  Build failure, no test results  BUILD-4  Test X failed  BUILD-5  Test X failed    In the results of BUILD-4 and BUILD-5, Bamboo reports that test X has been failing since BUILD-4.  From this, developers incorrectly infer that the test passed in BUILD-3 and the change that caused this failure was introduced in BUILD-4.  In this case, it would be better to report that the test has been failing since BUILD-2.    h3. Case B    There's another interesting case that needs to be considered:    BUILD-6  Test X passed  BUILD-7  Build failure, no test results  BUILD-8  Build failure, no test results  BUILD-9  Test X failed    Here, the failure of test X could have been introduced in BUILD-7, BUILD-8 or BUILD-9.

"Improve the Bamboo startup script
There are several things wrong with the bamboo.sh startup script:    1) an option to specify which user to run Bamboo under  2) The startup script takes no care of CWD. Depending on which directory you're in the startup behaves differently.  3) if Bamboo stops abruptly or startup fails, it leaves a bamboo.pid file and this file causes future startup attempts to fail.  4) make use of the JAVA_HOME in bamboo.sh script, Bamboo defaults to the java executable in the System Path - we ask users to set JAVA_HOME, but we never use it in the script  5) Parameterize each of the startup option in RUN_CMD variable or read the options from wrapper.conf file.

"Agent upload of artifacts fails to set Content-Length in HTTP/1.1 (on lighthttpd or nginx)
 Bamboo Agent upload of artifacts fails to set Content-Length:, causes problems when using a proxy that implements strict HTTP/1.1    Our preferred reverse proxy solution is Lighttpd. However, use of Lighttpd resulted in failure of Bamboo Agents to upload artifacts to the Bamboo Server.    Upon investigation, we discovered the following error in the Lighttpd error logs:    2010-01-08 13:50:26: (request.c.1115) POST-request, but content-length missing -> 411     HTTP/1.1 - http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt - Section 4.4:        ...      For compatibility with HTTP/1.0 applications, HTTP/1.1 requests      containing a message-body MUST include a valid Content-Length header      field unless the server is known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant. If a      request contains a message-body and a Content-Length is not given,      the server SHOULD respond with 400 (bad request) if it cannot      determine the length of the message, or with 411 (length required) if      it wishes to insist on receiving a valid Content-Length.    And below in section 10.4.12:        10.4.12 411 Length Required        The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-      Length. The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid      Content-Length header field containing the length of the message-body      in the request message.    And further below in section :        14.13 Content-Length        The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the      entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or,      in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that      would have been sent had the request been a GET.        Content-Length = ""Content-Length"" "":"" 1*DIGIT        An example is        Content-Length: 3495        Applications SHOULD use this field to indicate the transfer-length of      the message-body, unless this is prohibited by the rules in section      4.4.        Any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.      Section 4.4 describes how to determine the length of a message-body      if a Content-Length is not given.        Note that the meaning of this field is significantly different from      the corresponding definition in MIME, where it is an optional field      used within the ""message/external-body"" content-type. In HTTP, it      SHOULD be sent whenever the message's length can be determined prior      to being transferred, unless this is prohibited by the rules in      section 4.4.    According to my research, both Microsoft IIS and Lighttpd are strict on this. I have confirmed that Lighttpd does not have a configuration option to disable this level of strictness. Apache, however, is lax about enforcing this rule. As a result, Apache works and Lighttpd fails.    Please correct the Bamboo Agent upload of artifacts to specify a Content-Length according to the specification defined above so we can switch back to Lighttpd.",2

"Cannot undo Maven POM dependency management
We have 200+ Maven plans configured on one Bamboo instance and some of them are nightly plans with a once-a-day trigger.     On upgrading to 2.5 I set all plans to use the Maven2 dependency management. The problem is that I don't want regular CI plans to trigger nightly plans(as they are resource intensive). When I remove POM dependency management from the nightly builds, it doesn't stop them from being triggered by regular CI plans. I have no choice now but to take the Maven 2 dep management off all plans.    Oh well, it was nice while it lasted.     So - any way to stop the Maven 2 dependencies from crossing from plans of one build strategy (polling) to plans of another (single daily build)?",3

Bamboo is somewhat started up but not responding to HTTP requests. JIRA has started its plugins, and in the starting of the JIRA Bamboo Plugin, some code tries to eagerly instantiate something in {{BambooServerManagerImpl.java}}:    {code}      protected boolean isGadgetAvailable(URI uri)      {          HeadMethod method = new HeadMethod(uri.toString());          try          {              httpClient.executeMethod(method);              return method.getStatusCode() < HTTP_STATUS_CODE_ERRORS;          }          catch(IOException e)          {              return false;          }          finally          {             method.releaseConnection();          }      }  {code}    i.e. JIRA is waiting on Bamboo to respond.    This should be fixed so that the attempted HTTP connection at least has a sensible timeout (60seconds?) before it gives up and moves along. That, or instantiate things not on the startup of a plugin but at a different point in the lifecycle.",5

"Persist some calculated data for ArtifactLink
From: https://atlaseye.atlassian.com/cru/CR-BAM-997#c17472    Chai:  Is there any reason why we wouldn't simply store the calculated values? One of the things was that size was not calculated for directories in fear that it was going to be too expensive (which it can be if artifacts are big). Thoughts?    Krystian:  If we decide to persist the url then we shall remember to update it once the buildKey will get changed (build move) which in my opinion adds complexity. We can however store a path with some kind of token to be replaced by planKey while property is being read (""/browse/%s/artifacts/build-123/whatever"")  If you want to persist artifact size as well, then we might calculate directory size (as it would be done once).    Chai:  Yeah for URL we could just store the calculated suffix (ie the thing that requires us to browse for an index.html etc) and leave out the prefix (that can just be apended, it's not expensive)  + we should store the full size for the directory, though it'd be good to do some testing to see if how much more time it adds (say for a Clover report over JIRA is a good test)",2

"Implicit 'Build Requirements' from 'Builders' are not removed when changing 'Builders', causes builds to not execute
When creating/copying a plan, there are implicit build requirements derived from the selected builder. These requirements can not be managed by the user, but are added and deleted on their behalf by Bamboo when selecting a builder.    In 2.6 build 1901 - 27 May 10, when one changed the builder for a plan; the old builder requirement is not removed from the plan:    !Build Requirements.png!    This causes the build to no be able to schedule on desired agents, leaving it in the build queue.    Once saved, the requirements can not be removed; cloning the build plan doesn't work around this issue.    This will only affect plans that change builders.",2

"""Block build if parent plans have unbuilt changes"" doesn't block when parent builds are queued
I have multiple component builds set up in bamboo, with the actual dependencies indicated in the build dependencies for those builds.   Set with a blocking strategy of ""Block build if parent plans have unbuilt changes"" - but I don't think this affects the issue.    Because of the graph of dependencies, and the current methodology of triggering builds in bamboo, the components at the end of the dependency tree can get build multiple times for the same root reason/submission.    Consider the builds:  || Build || Parent Plans ||  | parent | |  | child-A | parent |  | grandchild-B | parent \\  child-A |    If a change is submitted to parent source, then on a successful build, both child-A and grandchild-B builds are queued. Once child-A successfully builds, grandchild-B is queued.    Grandchild-b gets built twice (with non-deterministic results on the first build since it uses the current parent results and the previous child-A results).",2

Message: The --log-xml option is deprecated, please use --log-junit instead    Therefore the only way to successfully build with PhpUnit 3.4.3+ is to have ""Log test execution to XML file"" disabled.",2

"PHPUnit builder fails by default on Windows
I installed Babmoo 2.6.1. It found PHPUnit and added PHPUnit builder correctly without any user action.  However when I created and started a plan using the PHPUnit builder it fails with following error:    {code}  Failed to execute build: Cannot run program ""C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\phpunit"" (in directory ""C:\Users\Jacek Jaroczynski\bamboo-home\xml-data\build-dir\TEST-TEST""): CreateProcess error=193, %1 is not a valid Win32 application  {code}    The solution was to explicitly configure PHPUnit builder to point at *phpunit.bat* instead of *phpunit*",1

So the fact that the method is called in Bamboo v2.6.1 Build 1902 / jetty v6.1.15 implies that ServletContext.getMajorVersion() has returned 2 and that ServletContext.getMinorVersion() has returned 5.  But the method call in the plugin throws ""java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.servlet.ServletContext.getContextPath()Ljava/lang/String;"",  even if this method is supposed to exists in the servlet api 2.5.    This issue implies that in this setup (in a plugin with bamboo 2.6.1 Build 1902 and jetty v6.1.15), the servlet api 2.5 was broken somehow: the method must exists.  This is probably related to the fact that there are both servlet-api-2.4.jar and servlet-api-2.5.jar in ""Bamboo/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/"".    Workaround:  The following workaround was tested with success:  1. stop the bamboo server  2. backup and delete the file ""Bamboo/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/servlet-api-2.4.jar"" from your bamboo setup (but keep the servlet-api-2.5.jar)  3. restart the bamboo server  4. install the javamelody plugin    Thanks anyway for a great plugin architecture.    PS: The JavaMelody plugin goal is to monitor JIRA, Confluence and Bamboo servers.  ",1
"Allow ""Import With Maven"" for ""Restricted Administrators""
We differentiate between System Administrators and Administrators in Studio. System Administrators are Atlassian and Contegix, Administrators may be customers. I was told that these groups roughly map to the notion of Administrators (Studio: System Administrators) and Restricted Administrators (Studio: Administrators) in Bamboo.     The customer is allowed to perform certain administration tasks in Studio's Bamboo, amongst them f.e. to configure the build expiry (BuildExpiryAction). These actions define no interceptor ref and thus use the defaultStack (default-interceptor-ref, xwork.xml). The defaultStack contains as far as I can see only one interceptor for authorisation, that is the permissionCheck (com.atlassian.bamboo.security.acegi.intercept.web.WebworkSecurityInterceptorProxy) interceptor which delegates to an extension of Acegi's org.acegisecurity.intercept.AbstractSecurityInterceptor, com.atlassian.bamboo.security.acegi.intercept.web.WebworkSecurityInterceptor. The AbstractSecurityInterceptor is configured to check, amongst other things,  if principals trying to access   com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.aware.permissions.GlobalAdminSecurityAware instances possess one of these authorities: WW_ADMIN,WW_RESTRICTED_ADMIN,GLOBAL_READ (applicationContextAcegiSecurity.xml). The  administrative actions currently configured in Studio to be accessible by Restricted Administrators (Studio: Administrators) implement this interface and thus they are allowed to access the action.    My current task is to allow customers to create build plans from POMs (https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/JST-2328). This action, importMavenPlan (com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.actions.admin.ImportMavenPlanCheckoutPomAction) uses a different interceptor stack, buildConfig and globalAdminStackAlwaysValidate. Regarding permissions, as far as I can see, the WebworkSecurityInterceptor is still used due to globalAdminStackAlwaysValidate → basicAdminStackPreValidate →  permissionCheck, but the principal is only checked against these authorities: WW_READ,GLOBAL_READ due to the instance being ""only"" a com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.aware.permissions.GlobalReadSecurityAware (BambooActionSupport, see screenshot). The Restricted Administrators pass this test. However, a second permission check is applied in this configuration, the globalAdminStackAlwaysValidate → basicAdminStackPreValidate → globalAdmin (com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.interceptors.GlobalAdminInterceptor). This interceptor uses the com.atlassian.bamboo.security.acegi.acls.HibernateMutableAclServiceImpl in order to check if the principal has the ADMINISTRATION permission, which he has not (RESTRICTEDADMINISTRATION instead).    My request is to change the configuration for the importMavenPlan action in order to allow it to be used by Restricted Administrators. One way would be to use the default stack and implement GlobalAdminSecurityAware. I haven't checked what other implications that would have regarding the interceptor configuration. Thx for the help.",1

"Inline Importer Causes Upgrade Tasks To Fail
When doing an import either via the setup wizard (or checking the checkbox to not restart bamboo from the admin section) the upgrades are run within the same thread as the action so therefore maintain the same session object (via the sessionInViewFilter thingy) for every upgrade task.  This causes some nasty exceptions - the tasks assume they have a clean slate to work off.    We need to make the upgrades run in a separate thread which does not have the overarching session available to it, and just make the action thread hang around waiting for the other thread to finish.    I have attached an export which reproduces this problem. ",3

"Remove pre-2.0 upgrade tasks and provide protection against upgrade from pre 2.0 version
Krystian:  In the history of Bamboo we had several versions which were required to be used to upgrade to the newer version. Ie. to upgrade from Bamboo 1.0 to Bamboo 2.1 you need to execute upgrades to 1.1.2, 1.2 and 2.0.  The latest of this ""milestone-upgrade"" versions is 2.0. This is why I propose to drop all the upgrade tasks which were introduced by pre-2.0 versions. The main benefit would be dropping the last usages of old and usually deprecated APIs  According to https://extranet.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=636158922 it means all pre 801 upgrade tasks (18 of them)    Przemek:  + make it impossible to use new Bamboo version to upgrade from build number of pre-2.0.x version.  That check should have been included in 2.0.x anyway...    Marek:  +1, those upgrade tasks are in sources too long. For historical stuff we got subversion    Anton:  Yes, if we do this, Bamboo *must* lockup upon starting if it detects that it is being brought up against a version which is before 2.0.  We should also stop the user importing XML backups from pre 2.0 versions.  In all these cases the user should be given a very clear error message and no data should be changed.  Can I ask why do you bring this up now? What caused you to do this? If we do this, will this simplify some other work we need to do for 3.0?  How long will the work of stopping a pre 2.0 upgrade/import take?    Krystian:  Adding protection against upgrade/import from pre-2.0 version is rather simple and would require ~4h of work (including testing).  I'm bringing this now cause last week Przemek has spotted a small bug which was caused by internal use of deprecated API (BuildManager). I thought that releasing 3.0 is a good moment to drop this (and maybe other) legacy APIs which were deprecated in 2.7 and previous versions.  A lot of uses of deprecated API is buried in old upgrade tasks which led to idea I presented in my original email.  This will probably not simplify other work for 3.0 but has a potential to help us find forgotten usages of legacy code that should have been updated some time ago.",1

"Rather than error out when a git ssh URL is entered without a username, automatically embed it in the URL for the user
See BAM-7665 for background information.    Git needs the username to be in the URL for ssh.    By implementing BAM-7665, we error out whenever a git ssh URL is entered without a username.    I think it would be better if we provided a separate UI textfield for the username and embeded the username into the ssh URL.    In this case if the user enters a username into the URL we should error out and ask the user to enter the username into a separate UI field.",1

When upgrading to the new Atlassian Plaform, we've changed the expiry scheduler to be triggered by Bamboo start instead of plugin system startup event.
