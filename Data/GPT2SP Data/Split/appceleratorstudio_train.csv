"Allow selection by CamelCase
In another I-can't-name-it Eclipse based IDE, there's a feature where you can select things based on CamelCase, instead of by word, which is very handy.

"Android: Fastdev Server Support
We've recently implemented a new feature in Android called ""Fastdev"" that serves up Javascript and other files from the project's ""Resources"" folder directly to the app as it's running. The server itself is long running, and supports several launches of the app. Currently I'm spawning this as subprocess from builder.py, which seems to work from command line, but Eclipse still sees the ""Application installer"" script as running (I'm guessing because it is actually a subprocess). The solution would probably be to have the IDE run it directly if/when it isn't already running. The syntax for starting and stopping the server is pretty straight forward:  $MOBILESDK/android/fastdev.py start <path/to/project> $MOBILESDK/android/fastdev.py stop <path/to/project>  You can check if the server is running by looking for an existing lock file in:  <path/to/project>/.fastdev.lock",1

Currently, however, only one version of each SDK can exist for TiStudio at one time using the ""Install Titanium SDK from URL"" feature. The workaround is to download and extract the packages to the SDK directory manually.  The suggestion is to append the date to the end of the SDK version number (most likely by simply naming the SDK directory to reflect this format). Thus, the package:  http://builds.appcelerator.com.s3.amazonaws.com/mobile/1_6_X/mobilesdk-1.6.3-20110418162355-linux.zip  would be shown in the TiApp editor as:  1.6.3-20110418  To add weight to the argument for this feature, Marshall has also agreed that it would be extremely useful.",1

Description:  While testing studio, it was noted that new deployment targets could not be added to an existing project. For example, a project created for an Android deployment had the iOS targets grayed out.    It is possible to manually edit TiApp.xml to set targets to true. This enables the ""run on simulator"" for iOS, and in my test was able to launch the project in the simulator.     Steps to reproduce:  1) Create a new Titanium Mobile project in Studio  2) Select ""Android"" as the only deployment target  3) When the project is created, open TiApp.xml and note that only Android is available to select/deselect  4) Open the pure xml tab of TiApp.xml and set deploy target for iOS to ""true""    Result:  Your project can be launched in the simulator, but installed on device will launch then quit and has no icon.    Expected:  Either no ability to add or remove targets after project creation or the ability to add with the same default structure as during project creation.    Suggested solution:    * user checks platform option in tiapp.xml  * Call platform script to initialize new platform.

"Need to be able to pass additional emulator arguments from run/debug configurations
When a run/debug configuration is created, we need the ability to pass additional command-line arguments to the android emulator.    As an example, the -scale argument in order to use skins whose full scale causes them to be larger than the screen you are running on. For example, I am using the Motorola MD860 skin for the Atrix 4G whose screen is 960 pixels high. The resulting emulator window is some 1200 pixels high but my screen is only 900 pixels high. If you run the AVD from the AVD Manager, it offers the option to run with a particular screen size which uses the -scale argument. We need the capability to do this in Studio. I would recommend simply adding an extensible option to specify any additional command line arguments. The standard Eclipse launch configurator allows this on the configuration's Target tab but that appears to be disabled in Studio.    Please re-add the tab and allow those arguments to be passed to the emulator.

An auto-generated company id prefix during project creation (i.e., Xcode) would be helpful.  Xcode has this feature. Titanium and Eclipse do not.

"Run git clean on build subfolders during project clean
Anytime you do a *clean* on a Titanium mobile project, the *build/android* and *build/iphone* directories have any existing *.gitignore* files deleted. This is bothersome when those files are the easiest way to ensure that the *build/iphone* and *build/android* paths exist when storing a project on git. If they don't exist, a user attempting to build the project will get an error on their first attempt.    It would be ideal if, when a *clean* is performed on a project, that any existing *.gitignore* files were left untouched in those directories. Running a git clean should restore the project to the state it was check in with.",8
"TiApp Editor: add Edit > Undo and Redo functionality
Edit > Undo and Redo are not selectable when using the TiApp editor, nor do the Undo/Redo keyboard shortcuts work. As an outlier, the Undo (cntrl + z) keyboard shortcut happens to work in Windows 7.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Create a new project.  2. Open tiapp.xml in the TiApp Editor.  3. Change text in a field (such as Application ID).  4. Try the following commands:    Edit > Undo.  Edit > Redo.  Undo Keyboard Shortcut: (OS X: cmd + z), (Windows 7: cntrl + z).  Redo Keyboard Shortcut: (OS X: shift + cmd + z), (Windows 7: cntrl + y).    Expected Result:    Menu options should be selectable and work.  Keyboard shortcuts should work.    Actual Result:    Undo/Redo menu options and keyboard shortcuts do not work, with the exception of the Undo keyboard shortcut in Windows 7.",8

"Modules UI - Restrict the modules to an API-Level
We need to restrict the modules selection in the TiApp UI to an API-Level that is enforced on a module.    The platform team adds an api-level value into the module's manifest, and will add a modules-api-level into the 'version.txt' file of the Titanium SDK.    We'll need to read both to find an API level match, and do whatever needs to be done in the UI in order to allow selecting only valid modules, and display warnings when incompatible modules exist in the tiapp.    To test:  # Create a new Titanium Mobile project  # Open up tiapp.xml and add a module to the project using the modules panel (I used ti.greystripe). Note the module appears active  # Edit the module manifest file to raise the apiversion to something like ""3"" (current maximum version is 2 for 1.8/2.0)  # Save tapp.xml and restart Studio. Note that the module now appears still available, but should appear greyed out    Note that this change is only relevant to Android. iOS does not care about apiversions    ",13

Content Assist menu is persistent in the OS if the assist menu has focus (i.e., by clicking on it). Other OS program windows are now obfuscated by the content assist menu until the focus is shifted back to Titanium Studio proper. Screenshot attached.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Open Studio and create a new project (or open an existing project).  2. Click in the text editor of app.js (or any .js file).  3. Press control + space to bring up the content assist menu.  4. Select any item from the suggestion list by clicking on it (the menu as-is will not exhibit this behavior).  5. Open any other program (such as Chrome) and move the other program window over the content assist menu.

"Dashboard SDK install use case should allow users to specify desired installation directory
The way the Dashboard installs Titanium/Mobile SDKs, it requires the SDK paths to be set in the preferences. In the case where the default SDK paths don't exist or invalid (ie, the user doesn't have permission), you will not be able to change the SDK paths to a desired location.     To reproduce:  1. Have a valid Ti SDK setup  2. Export the all the preferences via File->Export->General->Preferences  3. Edit the exported preference entry: /instance/com.appcelerator.titanium.core/TITANIUM_SDK_PATH with an invalid path. I used a path that the user does not have permissions, /Users/invalidUser/xxx  Save the file  4. Launch Ti Studio  5. Import the preferences via File->Import>General->Preferences  6. Restart Ti Studio  Expected: Ti SDK installation starts and prompts for a new location for installation  Actual: Ti SDK installation starts and fails    The same issue is exhibited with the Android SDK as well. The preferences for them are:  /instance/com.appcelerator.titanium.mobile/ANDROID_SDK_PATH    The installation is triggered via the configuration in the Dashboard      The installation should validate the SDK location to ensure it is valid (exists/write permission), if it is not the user is prompted for a new location",5

"Test build participant infrastructure
This involves taking the current built participant infrastructure, reviewing the test plans and unit tests, and performing the tests.    Current wiki: https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tp/TiStudio+Build+Participant+Test+Plan    Suggested approach:    * Review the above test plan. The list of test cases is incomplete. Don't worry about fleshing them out fully. Instead, take Chris's feedback and Thomas's feedback (shown below) to create a set of test scenarios at the top of the file and run through those. We will leave the creation of exhaustive test cases to later when we have more QA resources.  * Review the unit tests. See if they exercise the functionality. Run them through Emma to check for code coverage  * Run the test scenarios and file any bugs found.    To Test:  Checkout the ""participant"" branch of studio3, studio3-ruby and studio3-php    Thomas's feedback:  * All tests are marked as full. The point of a test plan is to break functionality into smoke, acceptance and full levels of test. If the tester can't figure out these coverage levels, they need to work with dev to figure it out.  * Resource requirements are not filled out - now way of knowing from this plan what Os are being tested or targeted  * An actual description of what ""Build Participant functionality"" is would be helpful if the test plan is going to be run by anyone other than the author. There seems to be multiple features in the test cases  * No risks or assumptions are filled out  * Often missing set up steps - For the PHP and Ruby specific test cases, how do we setup our environment to test those test cases?  * Under genericized tests, it says ""Applicable to all languages."" Which programming languages is being tested: JS, Java, Objective C?  * Unclear if it applies to Aptana or Tistudio.   * Not seeing links to any dev specs: http://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tis/Participating+in+the+build+and+reconcile+process    Ignore for now:    * Overall, the test cases should be more detailed since the test plan seems to be dealing with different programatic syntax and the test plan needs to clearly define what it is testing. (ignore for now)  * Not sure of why the tests at the top are repeated from 1012 on with a ""syntactically sound"" js file. Is there a target for this specific set of tests?  * In the ""Declarations and documentation"" tests, need specific examples for the programatic syntax (e.g. Document a class, declare a class, declare a function etc.)  * 1112 - 1115 refer to Aptana Studio.

"Titanium Studio: Improved error reporting in preferences window for invalid Android SDK
I had a bad Titanium SDK install. Not entirely sure how it happened, but the end result was some files were missing or corrupt. The end result was that, in the Titanium Preferences, I was getting an error saying that no Android SDK was found at my android sdk path. Upon much hand-wringing, eventually I was told to look at the Titanium log, which had an error ""!MESSAGE (Build 1.0.0.1326828513) [ERROR]  /usr/bin/python: can't open file '/Users/shan/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.1.v20120123161633/android/avd.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory"", which made the problem pretty obvious.    It would be great if:    1. Titanium Studio would have alerted me that there was an error, instead of saying that my Android SDK could not be found.  2. If that can't easily be accomplished, the error text displayed on the Preferences screen should have ""Check the Titanium Studio log for more information."" appended to it.",13

I profiled the performance issue. The root cause is creation of all the snippets when the view is loaded. A solution would be to lazy load the creation of the snippets until they are shown.

Just need to make sure ""mobileweb"" is added to the call if the mobile web checkbox is checked.    Side effects of not specifying this argument today is that the mobileweb resources folder will not get copied into the project's resources folder and then the appicon, favicon, apple touch icons, and apple startup images won't be displayed in the app.  Undoubtedly there will be more logic performed during project creation in the future, so we need to have this argument added.

"Update Titanium Mobile Snippets contributions to provide more context and improve discoverability 
With the introduction of the Snippets View (https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tools/Snippets+View), we need update the existing snippets to add more context and improve discoverability.

"Studio: Android SDK detection relies on script in latest Titanium SDK in mobilesdk folder, giving misleading info during failure
Description:  To determine if the Android SDK is properly configured, Studio relies on a script (avd.py I believe) in the latest Titanium SDK in the Titanium SDK folder. This is problematic in some circumstances including when a developer installs a development Titanium SDK. Studio will automatically defer to this new version for verification of the correct configuration of the Android SDK. If there is an issue with the script or some other problem with the folder structure of the development Titanium SDK, it will disable the ability of Studio to use Android projects. Since it is not possible for QE to verify every development release has the correct structure and that the and.py script is present and functional, this is a potential risk area.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Configure studio to have 1.8.0.1 GA as the latest SDK  2) Install an SDK from master branch (1.9.0)  3) navigate to the folder for the 1.9.0 SDK and remove SDK FOLDER/android/avd.py  4) In studio, select the titanium preference pane or click ""configure..."" from the TIapp.xml overview    Result:  Android preference states ""Could not locate the Android SDK at the given path""    Expected:  Android SDK configuration verification based on method that is independent of Titanium SDK",13

"Should check and load the existing .project file before setting our required natures/builders when creating or importing a project we support
Currently in our project creation or import wizards, we always create a new project description using IWorkspace.newProjectDescription() and then set nature ids and builders on it, but there is a possibility that the directory we're creating the project in or importing from already has a .project file.  The correct way would be:    1. Check if a .project file exists in the specified directory;  2. Load project description from the .project file using IWorkspace.loadProjectDescription();  3. Check if the project description already contains the natures and builders that we need and only add the missing ones;  4. If the project description isn't modified because it already includes the natures and builders we need, there will not be a need to call IProject.setDescription(); otherwise, call the method to update the .project file.

"Titanium Studio: titanium.py create: iphone project imported into studio does not include ipad as a selected target
When an iphone project is created using 'titanium.py create', and imported into studio, ipad is not selected as a deployment target.    This is relevant because projects imported into studio after being created by 'titanium.py create' do not initially contain tiapp.xml deployment target tags.  The tags are created on import based on the presence of a respective platform folder (i.e., NewProject/iphone).   Because iPad and iPhone use the same folder, they should both be selected as targets when imported to studio for the first time.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Generate a new iphone project using titanium.py create, such as:    {code:title=}  //  dhydeMBPLion:~ dhyde$ /Users/dhyde/Library/Application\ Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/1.8.1/titanium.py create --platform=iphone --type=project --dir=/Users/dhyde/Downloads --name=NewProject --id=com.appcelerator.project  //  {code}    2.

"Only check apiversion tag in manifest for Android modules
iPhone modules are displayed as not supported when the Titanium SDK version is set to version 1.8.0.1 or newer. This appears to be due to the fact that the manifest file for iPhone modules currently do not include the 'apiversion: 2' entry. The 'apiversion' entry was added for Android modules in Titanium SDK version 1.8.0.1 to indicate that the internal module API had changed. This change only impacted Android modules and it should be checked for Android modules because older versions of Android modules will not work with Titanium SDK version 1.8.0.1 or newer (and vice-versa). This is not the case for iPhone modules (currently).    The check for the 'apiversion' tag should ONLY be done for Android modules. It should be ignored for iPhone modules.    To test:    # Create a new Titanium Mobile project  # Open up tiapp.xml and add a module to the project using the modules panel (I used ti.greystripe). Note the module appears active  # Edit the module manifest file to raise the apiversion to something like ""3"" in the iOS and Android (current maximum version is 2 for 1.8/2.0)  # Save tapp.xml and restart Studio.

"Studio: Tiapp.xml editor gets out of sync and warns of changes in filesystem.
Description:  WHile testing, Natalie noticed that her changes to Tiapp (for the SDK version) were not being reflected, and subsequent builds were still using the previous SDK setting. We investigated, and noted that manipulating the pop-up for the SDK version would warn that the file had changed on the file system,and did she want to sync. With Shalom running us through some tests we determined a few things, most disconcerting is the fact that the Tiapp XML view had a different SDK listed than showed in the Overview. This explained the issue with building with the wrong SDK.    We still are investigating why the TiApp.xml is showing as out of sync from the file system perspective.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Install and run Studio  2) Create a project and build for device  3) Open TiApp.xml editor and change SDK then save  4) Continue to change SDK and save until you get warned about file system sync    Result:  After a few moments you should see the sync warning. You may also notice if you examine the XML that the SDK setting is not matching.    Expected:  No sync warnings simply manipulating the tiapp. No SDK setting mismatch.",8

Click on the Publish button and select the option for Package Mobile Web  3. In the pop up window, select the third option for Create a new project for the new mobile web app  4. Put in a project name and click on Publish (do it at least 2x quickly)    A packaging error is shown with the message ""Failed to package project"" ",8

"Running package operations (on multiple platforms) on the same project multiple times causes errors
Since package operations are now public launch configurations, you can run multiple configurations in quick succession. This will cause errors since the package operations operate on the build directory. We should queue up the launch configurations so they are sequential, scheduling launches based on the project.    Steps:  1. Create a mobile project with iOS, Android and mobile web deployment targets  2. Perform project package for iOS  3. Perform project package for android  4. Perform project package for mobile web  5. From the run shortcut, re-run 2/3/4 operations multiple times    Expected:  Each package operation completes successfully    Actual:  Error occurs",8
"Auto-select API version of Android SDK if available
When the Android SDK is installed, auto-select (in Preferences > Titanium > Default Android SDK) the ""Google APIs..."" version of the correct Android SDK version for the installed Titanium SDK version. This will make it easier for new users installing Titanium for the first time, who are unaware of the difference between the standard and enhanced Android SDK versions.    Note that this request may be somewhat related to TISTUD-1350 when implemented.",5
"Add Xcode Version Manager
Currently, if a user has both Xcode 4.2 and Xcode 4.3 installed, they would have to manually execute xcode-select to switch the Xcode version used for iOS operations.     I propose we do the following  -Update the Titanium preferences for IOS SDK home to be a combo box  -The combo box contains a list of detected Xcode locations  -Upon applying the changes, we call the sudo xcode-select -switch command  ",13

When enabling the ACS on Windows, the ACS labels at the TiApp cloud section get cut off from the bottom.  (see screenshot)    It's visible only when enabling ACS. When re-opening the TiApp editor, it looks fine.",3
"Add description to iOS SDK location to describe how to run with different Xcode versions
For Xcode4.3, the xcode-select command must be run to ensure properly function of the iOS platform scripts. Running the command can be foreign and difficult for some users. We should display a informative description and link on how to run xcode-select. There should be a linked wiki/doc page that describes in further detail on how to run the command.     The description should be included in the iOS section of the Titanium preferences. It should state:  ""If the desired Xcode installation is not displayed, you will need to run ""sudo xcode-select <xcode_folder_path>"" to target a specific installation. <a>More details</a>""",8
"Add platform attribute to module element(s)
When a module that supports only a single platform is added to a project using the new modules table, the module element is added to tiapp.xml but it is missing the platform tag.     Steps to reproduce:    1. Create a new mobile application project -- use defaults of all application target types  2. Click on the button to add a new module (+)  3. Select a module that is only available on one platform (e.g. ti.push)  4. Save the project  5. Attempt to run the application in the iPhone simulator  6. Build should fail with an error indicating that the ti.push module is missing    Without the 'platform' tag on the module entry, the build script will attempt to locate the module for all application targets. The module element needs to include the 'platform' tag so that the module is only searched for when building for that target. For example, 'platform=""android""'.     Also, without the 'platform' tag the module displays in the Modules table with its version number available on all platforms -- which is incorrect since it is only available on the single platform.

"Add URL bar to integrated mobileweb preview
The integrated web preview in TiStudio does not expose the local URL to which the preview pane is connected. You can see it in the title bar of TiStudio itself, but its not copyable. It would be helpful to have the URL bar shown above mobileweb preview panes. ",3
"Add ability to read packaged rubles from the Titanium SDK directory
As we move towards having per-SDK-version samples and templates, it makes sense that those items would be contributed from the platform itself.    Propose a file structure like:    /Application/Library Support/titanium/mobilesdk/<platform>/<version>/studio    or we could put them in modules:    /Application/Library Support/titanium/modules/studio/<version>    Studio would need to inspect the SDK directory and read from a crafted set of directories for Rubles in specific locations.",13
"Auto-configure browser list to contain all installed browsers on Windows
Description:  While attempting to set a browser before running a mobile web preview, I noticed that the list of browsers did not include any specific browsers except firefox. It would be ideal to populate the list of installed browsers rather than have the user populate the list manually.     Steps to reproduce:  1) Install Studio  2) Create project with mobile web target  3) Run in browser  4) Select ""run configurations"" and use the browser selection section    Result:  Firefox is the only 3rd-party browser listed although I have Chrome, Firefox, and Safari    Expected:  Firefox not displayed, or all installed browsers displayed    ",20

While evaluating ACS features, we encountered an Android issue that was supposed to have been fixed in the latest ti.cloud module. Upon further investigation we determined that the module was in fact included with the latest CI build. We conducted a few experiments and determined that although the module was updated, the name was the same so during the unzipping process, the module was not replacing the existing older module.    Steps to reproduce:  1) Delete your existing common JS module folder from the Titanium folder  2) install a CI build from 3/24 or before  3) Check the contents of the module folder  4) install a CI build from 3/27 or later  5) Check the contents of the module folder    Results:  The ti.cloud module is the older broken module, not the newer fixed module    Expected:  The module is overwritten by the newer module with the same name.

The preselected provisioning profiles is not clear, and somehow I managed to build against an ad-hoc certificate, i did not consciously choose this) but it caused my Push Notification Process to throw up errors.    I tried 2 possible certs that were available to me and both times it must have used an ad-hoc certificate.    I went back to 1.x and rebuilt it. I preferred the ability to remove and add certificates manually at this stage. Always avoided confusion for me. ",8

"Studio displays iOS ad hoc provisioning profiles as ""development"" when it should be ""distribution""
Studio displays Ad hoc provisioning profiles incorrectly as ""development"". This causes confusion in the following areas:    -Preferences displays the displays the type incorrectly  -The iOS distribution wizard displays Apple iTunes, Ad hoc, and development profiles (should only display Apple iTunes and Ad hoc profiles)  -The iOS Run on device wizard displays Apple iTunes, Ad hoc, and development profiles (should only display development profiles)    Special attention must be made to the way we cache provisioning profiles, since a fix to the SDK will not update the ""type"" of the cached provisioning profiles. We have to trigger a flush of the cache if there is a presence of SDK 2.2.0, where previously there wasn't.    This is blocked by an SDK bug",8

"Editor: JavaScript Comment Auto-Complete initially fails to recognize preexisting blocks and cursor is incorrectly positioned
JavaScript Comment Auto-Complete initially fails to recognize preexisting blocks and cursor is incorrectly positioned. I am marking this as a bug because the auto-comment partially works, and I can get into this bad state. Screenshot attached.    The auto-complete kicks in after pressing enter twice, but the cursor is on the wrong line.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Enter code in JS file:    {code}  /**/  {code}    2.

"Android: allow users to launch x86 emulator
h2. Description    Developers need to be able to leverage the Android x86 emulator that was made available with Android SDK r17. It claims to have performance increases beyond the standard emulator making for a better development experience.    h2. Proposed Solution(s)    It would be good if you could specify by default whether you want to use the x86 or standard emulator for all projects, perhaps in {{Preferences -> Titanium Studio -> Titanium}}. It should be the standard emulator by default as the x86 emulator currently does not include the Google APIs (which would prevent the KitchenSink from running) and it does not support V8, as detailed in the linked ticket.    Also, it should be configurable on a per-project basis as well, for the same reasons I listed in the above paragraph.    So:    # We need to upgrade our AVI detection to show the available ABIs per device  # For devices with multiple ABIs we need to allow the user to select which one to use as part of the launch configuration, and that is passed as the first argument to the SDK for SDKs 2.1+. For < 2.1, we only pass the device argument  # We could add a preference in Titanium Preferences to default to x86 or standard emulator (were available). This would se the default ABI selection in the launch configuration.  ",13

When trying to promote a folder to a project in full screen / maximised mode, Titanium Studio moves when the Promote to Project dialogue box opens.    This bug is a regression, this issue does not happen in 2.0.1.    Steps to reproduce:  1. Open Titanium Studio in Maximised Mode.  2. In the Project Explorer open the context menu for a folder.  3. Select ""Promote to Project"".    Expected Results: The Dialogue box would open without a change in Titanium Studio's location on the screen.

"Titanium Studio: module packaging to project with dirty tiapp.xml fails to write module xml tags
If a module is packaged to a project with a dirty tiapp.xml (i.e., a module was just deleted using the red X), the module xml tags will not be written to the project tiapp.xml.    This is not a regression. There is no log.    This is related to TISTUD-1666, but this is a separate edge case.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Create a new project.  2. Create a new module.  3. Package the module to the project.  4. Delete the module from the project using TiApp Editor Overview (click the red X to delete module).    This will dirty the tiapp.xml file and remove the module xml tags, but keep the module folder in the project.    5. While the editor is still dirty, package the module again to the project.    Expected Result:    Module should package and appear in TiAPP Editor Overview, xml tags for the module should exist in the tiapp.xml file.    Actual Result:    Module packages, but does not appear in the TiAPP Editor Overview. The xml tags are not generated.    It is worth noting the module tags will be added if the tiapp.xml file is dirty from other kinds of edits (i.e., changing the app version from 1.0 to 2.0).",8

While testing pricing we noted an application appeared on Neha's ""my apps"" list shortly after she tried to create an HTML-based template project in studio.

Studio should check for the JAVA_HOME before beginning a build, check if it is correctly set, and if it is missing or incorrect pass in a correct version into the build.    This issue is a not a regression since the bug is due to a user mis-configuration of JAVA_HOME.    Steps used to reproduce:  1. Ensure that the $JAVA_HOME global variable is set ( ls -R $JAVA_HOME ).  2. Create a new Titanium Mobile Project.  3. Create a signing key.  4.

Switching back to SDK 2.0.2GA fixes the issue in all studio platforms, as 2.1.0 is the first version to use JAVA_HOME in the packaging scripts.

"Dashboard: Dashboard displays old version for build numbers higher then 2.X
After updating to the nightly 3.3.0.201209032204 build of Titanium Studio, I now only get the generic old dashboard rather then the new dashboard. Loading in any 2.X build of Titanium Studio loads the correct dashboard.    This is a regression as this works in the 2.x builds.    Steps to reproduce:  1. Install any Titanium Studio build in the 2.x range.  2. Upgrade from the nightly build to 3.3.0.201209032204.  3. Open Titanium Studio.    Expected results: The dashboard should correctly load with the new dashboard content.    Actual results: The dashboard loads with the default older dashboard (see screenshot).",5

"TiApp Editor: prompt to save when focus leaves tiapp editor
Android Device Debugger: debug drop-down menu fails to list device option if tiapp.xml is dirty yet has a valid SDK.    For instance, if a project has SDK 2.1.2 selected in the tiapp.xml and the xml is saved, then the tiapp.xml sdk version is changed to 3.0.0 but not saved, the debug to device option is not available under Debug > Android Device until the tiapp.xml is saved.

We are reading the tiapp.xml that is saved, not the one in memory (OR we should just list all run options by default because there is already an invalid config error, see screenshot 'Correct Error').

"Studio: Build for device and packaging show a list of simulators instead of SDK.
While investigating issues discovered with Xcode 4.5, it became clear that what we were seeing as a bug where the SDK scripts were ignoring what was set as iOS SDK during Studio build for device or packaging was actually Studio displaying a list of simulator versions.    This option should show either the actual list of SDK versions. The result of setting something other than an available SDK is that the setting is ignored. Since this is a list of emulators, this happens nearly every build (unless you choose a version where you have both simulator and SDK).    This is not a regression, it occurs in many previous versions.     Steps to reproduce:  1) Ensure xcode-select path and Studio preference are in sync.

When testing the deprecation fixes in SDK, I noticed that studio is now displaying links (yay!) except that they don't go anywhere (boo!).

So links to Titanium types, for example, show up as something like this:    {code}  <a href=""Titanium.Proxy.applyProperties"">applyProperties</a>  {code}    So, we either need to remove the links from the JSCA or Studio needs to handle these in some useful fashion.",8

"Sync common preferences between Studio and titanium CLI
I'm not sure if CLI wants us to be setting global values in config to match or not, but I'm guessing by default we should sync up the values for things like Android SDK path. If a user sets the path in Titanium Studio we should pass that along to the CLI to store as well. We may also need to do the reverse on startup - look up what CLI has in it's config and push that into our prefs (with some sanity check to see if the value is valid - or at least ""more valid"" than what we have set).",8

"Use same sudo prompt UI for Node and npm packages
On a clean install we get prompted to install Node. After accepting we get a sudo prompt from cocoasudo. After that finishes we then get a prompt to install acs using a different prompt UI (but again for sudo password). We should have a consistent UI for prompting the sudo password. Additionally, since less than my sudo password expiration time passed between the two, hopefully I wouldn't even get prompted (for my password, but maybe for acceptance) the second time.",5
"Unify the handling of installing and updating processes
Our handling of installing requirements are pretty inconsistent. We have the Titanium SDK Updater which checks on startup for updates to Titanium SDK, titanium CLI, alloy, and acs. But we also have separate IStartup checks for acs and alloy. Additionally our check for Node is done entirely separately.    Ideally we'd have the check for updates _always_ run regardless of prefs.

We may need to alter indexing/CA to determine the proper Global type to use based on the file's location, or project nature. We can safely assume that any inline JS in an HTML file will use Window.    Beyond that we may just want to assume Window for all except Titanium Mobile or Node.ACS projects.",8

"Improve the first page of Update wizard
1. Grey out 'Titanium SDK' field in the installer main page to indicate that it is mandatory and as the user can not de-select it and add "" (required)"" to the text. This should only apply to the case where user doesn't have a SDK installed; if a SDK already exists, the field will be de-selectable.    2. The text of NodeJS should dynamically switch to 'NodeJS (required)' if the user selects any of the npm packages.    3. When NodeJS is selected, the release note section should be updated with at least the default text.  ",5
"Titanium Updates: change sudo prompt to mock system modal dialog
Change studio 3.0.1 sudo prompt to a modal dialog (that existed in studio 3.0.0).    This is a regression, studio 3.0.0 had a nice system-style dialog. See screenshots.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Uninstall the CLI (or ACS, Alloy, NodeJS).  2. Open Studio. Take Titanium Updates.    Actual Result:    Sudo prompt appears in a wizard, appears non-standard.    Expected Result:    Sudo prompt appears as it does in studio 3.0.0, as a modal dialog that mocks the system dialog.",5

We'd like to provide CA for alloy APIs. We need to look into whether we can simply index the alloy source with the JSDuck comments to do so. We may need to extend our SDoc support to cover more tags provided by JSDuck (https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck)     If we can simply index the JS files with the JSDuck comments, then we can pretty easily fold this into our general node modules indexing, since the source will be available in the alloy module (/usr/local/lib/alloy/Alloy)",8

Our current load provider support re-uses the index for the project, which isn't really correct - and it is assumed to return a lit of files to index, which we can do, but it may be easier to just return the directories.    Ideally the NodeJS install as a whole would be a single ""entry"" (like a JRE/KDK for JDT) and it resolves to it's various paths and is indexed to it's own index/indices.

"Index external build path entries separately from project index
Our current mechanism for build path entries is not as flexible and useful as we'll need to properly make use of it for NodeJs/Titanium/etc.  Currently we can only have a contributor that supplies entries pointing at single files (JSCA), and hook them up to projects. The list is stored as a persistent property ont he project - which is not portable across workspaces and other users, so we should likely write them out to a {{.buildpath}} file likes JDT does with {{.classpath}}.     Additionally, those files are ""contributed"" to the list run through our builder for a project. So they get merged into the project's index itself. For each build entry we should be able to point at a single file or a directory tree, and then index all of it. Each entry should be recorded into it's own index file, so multiple projects referencing the same entry can reuse the same index (i.e. Titanium SDK 2.1.4GA API).    Lastly, the querying of indices would need to be altered os that we can ask for the ordered list of entries for a project, get the corresponding indices and query them. (rather than hard-coding the project's index and sometimes the ""metadata"" index).",20

"Alloy Debugger: wrong behavior setting breakpoints on functions under Android
h5. Problem description  Debugger is not correctly handling a breakpoint set for a function in the controller .js file    h5. Steps to reproduce  Android OS tested: 2.3.6 Nexus One, Android emulator    See the sample attached.    h6. index.xml  {code}  <Alloy>  	<Window class=""container"">  		<Label id=""label"" onClick=""doClick"">Hello, World</Label>  	</Window>  </Alloy>  {code}    h6. index.js  {code}  function doClick(e) {    	      alert($.label.text);    }    $.index.open();  {code}    1. Set a BreakPpoint at line 3 for the'alert($.label.text);'  2. Debug the App on Android     Result: App starts but the breakpoint is immediately triggered before displaying the Window (so just the splashscreen is displayed) and without having to click on the label.    From the Debug tab, it looks the behavior is wrong and that actually the wrong line is highlighted, focusing on the 'doClick() function' instead of the 'alert' function inside.    See the two screenshots, one for Android (wrong behavior), one for iOS (correct one, being triggered only when clicking on the sample 'label' for displaying the alert, not when starting the App).    3. Click to go past the breakpoint. Manually click on the app label to trigger the alert again.  Result: breakpoint is now ignored. Alert is being displayed.      Attaching Debugger log, where there is this line (not present in the iOS debugger log):  {code}  [57:33.986] Recv: >1364417853985*!unknown option <monitorXHR><  {code}    Attaching Android build.log too",8

"Code Analyzer: Alloy: When a Warning or Error is found for an Alloy project, code gutter icons are added to the Resources project files, not to App folder
h5. Problem description  When a Warning or Error is found by the Code Analyzer for an Alloy project, Warning or Error icons are placed in the code gutter in the Resources file projects instead than in the App file projects. The result is that the Project is now marked with the red/white error icon and the 'Errors in Workspace' alert is displayed every time the project is being build.     'Resources' folder is by default not visible for Alloy projects on Studio, so the default result is also that the project is marked with an error icon, but the user can't see any other red error icon next to any visible Project file.    Also, having an error or a warning reported for the Alloy compiled code in the Resources folder is not adding much value for the user as the intended behavior is not to manually modify the compiled code files in the Resources (user should only handle Alloy files, all included into the App folder).    h5. Steps to reproduce    Paste the sample code. Note the code error in the controller.js , where foobar is actually not a function.  The error is correctly reported by the Code Analyzer (see the screenshot), also getting the correct position in the Alloy project.  However, in Studio the Error icon is placed in 'Resources/alloy/controllers/index.js' , which is hidden by default and should in any case manually modified by the user.    h6. controller/index.js  {code}  $.mainwin.foobar({  	backgroundColor : 'blue'  });      $.index.open();  {code}    h6. index.xml  {code}  <Alloy>  	<Window title=""Win 1"" id='mainwin'>  		<Label>I am Window 1</Label>  		<Button>Click</Button>  	</Window>  </Alloy>  {code}      h5.

Edit views/index.xml  {code}  <Alloy>  	<Window>  		<!-- Localization via XML attribute -->  		<Label class=""header"">via XML attribute:</Label>  		<Label text=""L('hello_world')""/>    		<!-- Localization via TSS -->  		<Label class=""header"">via TSS:</Label>  		<Label id=""viaTss""/>    		<!-- Localization via JS code in controller -->  		<Label class=""header"">via controller:</Label>  		<Label id=""viaController""/>  	</Window>  </Alloy>  {code}    3. Edit styles/styles.tss  {code}  'Label': {  	top: '5dp',  	color: '#222',  	font: {  		fontSize: '42dp',  		fontWeight: 'bold'  	},  	height: Ti.UI.SIZE,  	width: Ti.UI.SIZE,  	textAlign: 'center'  }    '.header': {  	top: '30dp',  	color: '#a00',  	font: {  		fontSize: '24dp',  		fontWeight: 'normal'  	}  }    '#index': {  	backgroundColor: '#fff',  	fullscreen: false,  	exitOnClose: true,  	layout: 'vertical'  }    '#viaTss': {  	text: L('hello_world')  }    {code}    4. Edit controllers/index.js  {code}  $.viaController.text = L('hello_world');    $.index.open();  {code}    Result: Studio is showing two error markings in the styles/index.tss - the first on the first line ('Cannot recover from the syntax error'), the second on the localization line (unexpected token ""L"").

"Field Service: In description of Field Service Sample in Dashboard we should state to read the ReadMe to configure
There are users and partners that have not been able to get the Field Service App to work.  It turns out many of them is because they didn't look at the ReadMe.  I believe that if we state it in the description, then more users will actually look at the readme and this should increase the overall success of the Field Service App.    ""Please read the ReadMe file in order to complete the configuration of the application.""  Or something like that.",2
"Liveview: iOS: Second launch of LV enabled project in iOS simulator fails 
h5. Description:  When launching a Liveview enabled simulator session, it works as expected. When you attempt to rebuild the project again, the simulator fails to launch and this error presented:    {code}  [INFO] :   Finished building the application in 1s 97ms  [LiveView] Closing file/event server process id: 34204  [INFO] :   Running application in iOS Simulator  [LiveView] version 0.1.32  [LiveView] File Server Started on Port 8324  [LiveView] Event Server Started on Port 8323  [INFO] :   Launching application in iOS Simulator  [INFO] :   Focusing the iOS Simulator  [ERROR] :  Failed to focus the iPhone Simulator window  [ERROR] :  /Users/emerriman/Library/Application Support/Titanium/mobilesdk/osx/3.1.2.v20130807171139/iphone/iphone_sim_activate.scpt: execution error: iPhone Simulator got an error: Connection is invalid. (-609)  [INFO] :   Application has exited from iOS Simulator  [INFO] :   Project built successfully in 3s 58ms  {code}    This occurs with both the iPad and iPhone simulators. The order of the console output may vary slightly.    Also note that the behavior prevents the user from turning off LV and then launching on the first attempt. The first launch with LV off after encountering this error will fail with the same console output. The second launch with LV off seems to work fine. This may be a clue as to root cause.    h5. Steps to reproduce:  1) Create a default classic project in Studio  2) Enable Liveview and launch in the simulator  3) Make some edits if you wish  4) Relaunch the simulator - leaving liveview enabled    h5. Result:  Project fails to launch correctly in the simulator. Turning off LV and launching will also fail, but will work on the next and subsequent launches with LV off.    h5. Expected Result:  Project launches as expected and allows real-time editing    h5. Notes  I monitored the processes here, and it may be expected but subsequent launches of Liveview were killing the existing node PID and launching a new one.
