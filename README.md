This repository contains the code for the comparative learning framework described in "Efficient Story Point Estimation With Comparative Learning".


## Dependencies
The required dependencies must be installed to run the source code.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
Story point estimation data and its pre-split training, validation and testing splits can be found under Data/GPT2SP/Split/

## Comparative learning experiments
Once the dependencies are installed, run the corresponding files to run the comparative learning experiments with the default parameters. The parameters values can be changed to conduct different experiments.

The experiments can be run using the command -
```
python PairwiseExperiments.py
```
